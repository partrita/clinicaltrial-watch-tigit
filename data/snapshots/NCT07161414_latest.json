      "detailedDescription": "This is a Phase I, open-label, multicenter, multi-part, dose finding and dose confirmation study to evaluate the PK and safety of SC rilvegostomig.\n\nThe study includes 2 parts: Part 1 (Dose Finding) and Part 2 (Dose Confirmation).\n\nPart 1 will determine a SC rilvegostomig dose co-administered with rHu that yields drug exposure comparable with IV rilvegostomig. It will include 2 planned dose levels (DL1 in Cohort A and DL2 in Cohort B). Additional dose levels will be added, if needed.\n\nPart 2 will be initiated once a dose has been identified based on Part 1. This part will evaluate the bioavailability, safety, and tolerability of SC rilvegostomig + rHu."
