      "briefSummary": "The aim of this study is to investigate the safety and tolerability of Subcutaneous Immunotherapy treatment (SCIT) with incremental doses of a modified recombinant fish parvalbumin (mCyp c 1) quantified in mass units:\n\nTo establish a safe dose of the candidate hypo-allergen in human subjects and To study the pharmaco-dynamics of the hypo-allergen administered to human subjects.\n\nThe study is performed as a placebo-controlled double-blinded randomized trial with 24 fish allergic patients allocated into three different groups of eight.",
      "detailedDescription": "The aim of the FAST project in general is to develop novel recombinant allergen-based therapeutics for the treatment of food allergy. The chosen approach is to modify recombinant allergens into hypo-allergenic molecules to decrease the risk of anaphylactic side-effects and to allow administration of higher doses leading to better efficacy."
