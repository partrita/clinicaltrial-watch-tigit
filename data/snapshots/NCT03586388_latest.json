      "briefSummary": "Cow's milk (CM) allergy is the most frequent food allergy in the first years of life, with prevalence rates estimated in the range of 2-3%.\n\nThe elimination of CM is the mainstay of treatment, but accidental exposure to CM proteins is not uncommon, with a considerable risk of severe allergic reactions.\n\nRecent evidence suggests that early oral exposure in young children may protect to the development of allergy. On the same way, strategies have been developed for the use of oral exposure as immunotherapy for the treatment of children with established food allergy even if available data on the use of oral immunotherapy in infants with food allergy are very limited.\n\nThe aim of this study is to evaluate the feasibility of an oral immunotherapy protocol, started in the first year of life, in children with CM allergy."
