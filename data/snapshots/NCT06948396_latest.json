      "detailedDescription": "There is a current need to gain information on the clinical profile of patients eligible for treatment with Tezepelumab according to the approved and reimbursed indication in Italy. Moreover, being Tezepelumab the latest approved biologic drug for severe asthma, it is important to better understand clinical response to treatment in patients with high severe asthma burden as: patients with allergic-eosinophilic phenotype; patients with low eosinophils level; patients affected by severe asthma associated with sinonasal disease; biologic-naïve patients, as well as bio-treated patients. The present observational study aims at filling the above-mentioned knowledge gaps in the study population in terms of clinical course, disease control and clinical remission, use of healthcare resources (treatments, visits, hospitalizations), lung functions, biomarkers, and sinonasal outcomes."
