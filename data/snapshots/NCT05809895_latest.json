      "briefSummary": "The primary scientific question of interest of this study is whether the combination of ociperlimab, tislelizumab and chemotherapy improves progression-free survival (PFS) compared to the combination of placebo, pembrolizumab and chemotherapy as first-line therapy for adult men and women with advanced triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) whose tumors express programmed death ligand 1 (PD - L1) \\[combined positive score (CPS) ≥10\\], regardless of study treatment discontinuation or start of new anti-neoplastic therapy.",
      "detailedDescription": "This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter, Phase II study evaluating the efficacy and safety of ociperlimab in combination with tislelizumab and chemotherapy as first-line treatment for participants with advanced TNBC whose tumors express PD-L1 (CPS ≥ 10).\n\nAdditionally, the efficacy and safety of the triple combination (ociperlimab + tislelizumab + chemotherapy) will be assessed in Arm D (a separate single-arm, open-label cohort) in 30 participants with advanced TNBC whose tumors express PD-L1 (CPS ≥ 1 to \\< 10).\n\nStudy treatment will continue until the participant experiences one of the following: disease progression per investigator's assessment by Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1, unacceptable toxicity, pregnancy, treatment is discontinued at the discretion of the investigator or participant, start of a new antineoplastic therapy, withdrawal of consent, lost to follow-up, death, or study is terminated by the sponsor."

      "eligibilityCriteria": "Key Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Participant has histologically confirmed diagnosis of advanced (loco-regionally recurrent and not amenable to curative therapy, or metastatic (stage IV)) TNBC\n* Participant has completed systemic treatment for Stage I-III breast cancer, if indicated, and ≥ 6 months have elapsed between the completion of systemic treatment with curative intent and disease recurrence\n* A recently or newly obtained tumor biopsy from a metastatic site must be provided for determination of PD-L1 expression using the PD-L1 IHC 22C3 assay by a Novartis designated central laboratory, prior to study randomization. If a result of PD-L1 expression assessed by a PD-L1 IHC 22C3 pharmDx test in a local laboratory is available, this can serve as PD-L1 status confirmation. For Arms A, B and C participants must have PD-L1 positive tumors with CPS≥ 10. For Arm D, participants must have PD-L1 positive tumors with CPS ≥ 1 to \\< 10.\n* Participant has measurable disease, i.e., at least one measurable lesion per RECIST 1.1 criteria (a lesion at a previously irradiated site may only be counted as a target lesion if there is clear sign of progression since the irradiation)\n* Participant has an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 or 1\n* Participant has life expectancy ≥ 12 weeks from the start of study treatment\n\nKey Exclusion Criteria:\n\n* Participant has received prior treatment with immunotherapy in the metastatic setting, or anti-T cell immunoreceptor with Ig and ITIM domains (TIGIT) therapy in any setting\n* History of severe hypersensitivity to any of the study drugs (i.e. monoclonal antibodies, gemcitabine, carboplatin, nab-paclitaxel, paclitaxel) or its excipients or to drugs of similar chemical classes\n* Participant with inflammatory breast cancer at screening\n* Participant has central nervous system (CNS) involvement which was not previously treated and/or was newly detected at screening. Previously treated CNS involvement must fulfill the following criteria to be eligible for the trial:\n\n  1. Completed prior therapy (including radiation and/or surgery) for CNS metastases ≥ 28 days prior to the start of the study and\n  2. CNS tumor is clinically stable at the time of screening, and\n  3. Participant is not receiving steroids and/or enzyme inducing anti-epileptic medications for brain metastases\n* Participant has an active autoimmune diseases or history of autoimmune diseases that may relapse\n* Participant has not recovered from all toxicities related to prior anticancer therapies to National Cancer Institute (NCI) CTCAE version 5.0 Grade ≤1. Exception to this criterion: participants with any grade of alopecia are allowed to enter the study\n\nOther inclusion/exclusion criteria may apply",
