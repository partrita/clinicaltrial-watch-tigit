      "briefSummary": "In this prospective controlled monocentric observational study, we assessed safety and efficacy of therapy with IA or PE in patients with neurological autoimmune diseases. In the subgroup analysis of MS patients also the EDSS was evaluated. In addition, we investigated possible pathomechanisms, such as cytokine alterations under therapy.",
      "detailedDescription": "Plasma exchange (PE) and immunoadsorption (IA) are first- or second line treatment options in patients with neurological autoimmune disease, including multiple sclerosis, neuromyelitis optica, chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy, acute inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy (Guillain-Barré-Syndrom) or autoimmune encephalitis. This prospective controlled monocentric observational study of patients treated with either tryptophan IA or PE in cases of autoimmune neurological therapy refractory disease was performed between 2016 and 2019. The main outcome parameter for efficiency was clinical improvement after completion of treatment with PE/IA. Symptoms were assessed before the first and after the last IA/PE. In total, all patients receive 5 treatments. As patients with various neurological autoimmune diseases were included in the study, the overall treatment response was categorized descriptively as improvement or no improvement of symptoms."
