      "briefSummary": "INTRODUCTION: Asthma is a disease characterized by inflammation of the airway and secondary contraction of smooth muscle. Treatment for the crisis consist in the use of local and / or systemic bronchodilators and anti-inflammatories, and it has been shown that mechanical ventilation to the airway through non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) decreases bronchial hyperreactivity and contractility of smooth muscle.\n\nOBJECTIVES: To assess the effect of nocturnal NIPPV on local inflammation, systemic inflammation and the state of hypersensitivity in patients with asthma attack.\n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS: We will include patients with severe asthma attacks requiring hospitalization, without indication for acute NIPPV, and will be randomized to receive NIPPV with an spontaneous (S) bilevel or continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP, control group), all patients will receive standard treatment; gasometric exchange, local inflammation (FEV1 and Exhaled fraction of nitric oxide), systemic inflammation (C reactive protein, IL-4, IL-5, IL-13 and IL-17 in peripheral blood) and the hypersensitivity state (eosinophilia and IgE) between both groups will be compared after 4 days of treatment.",
      "detailedDescription": "RESEARCH QUESTION What is the effect of non invasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) on systemic inflammation in patients with asthma attacks?\n\nJUSTIFICATION Asthma is a global public health problem and one of the primary causes of care at the National Institute of Respiratory Diseases in Mexico; when presented as a crisis is a serious condition that puts the life of the patient at risk; in vitro and in vivo studies have shown that the application of chronic airway distention using non-invasive mechanical ventilation produces a reduction in bronchial hyperreactivity in patients with asthma and may have a positive effect on the treatment of this condition independent of its effects on ventilation in the presence of acute respiratory failure.\n\nHYPOTHESIS The use of NIPPV will improve systemic inflammation assessed by C reactive protein (CRP) in patients with severe asthmatic crisis.\n\nOBJECTIVES\n\nMain Objective:\n\nTo assess the effect of NIPPV on systemic inflammation measure through C reactive protein in acute asthma\n\nSecondary objectives:\n\n1. \\- To assess the effect of NIPPV on the days of hospital stay in patients with asthma attacks.\n2. \\- To evaluate adherence to NIPPV in patients with asthma attacks.\n3. \\- To evaluate the effect of NIPPV on PaO2, PaCO2 and SpO2 in patients with asthma attacks.\n4. \\- To evaluate the effect of NIPPV on FEV1 and Exhaled fraction of nitric oxide in patients with asthma attacks.\n5. \\- To evaluate the effect of NIPPV on serum levels of interleukin (IL)-4, IL-5, IL-13 and IL-17 in patients with asthma attacks.\n6. \\- To assess the effect of NIPPV on total eosinophil count and Immunoglobulin (Ig) E level in patients with asthma attacks.\n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\n\n1. Design: A prospective, longitudinal, comparative, parallel group study will be conducted; it was approved by the Science and Bioethics Committees of the National Institute of Respiratory Diseases Mexico with the code C34-14. In all cases, informed consent will be requested.\n2. Place: It will be carried out in the emergency and hospitalization service of the National Institute of Respiratory Diseases \"Ismael Cosío Villegas\" at Mexico city.\n3. \\- Procedures:\n\n   * Clinical history.\n   * Chest X-ray.\n   * Berlin Questionnaire. The Berlin questionnaire is a self-administered questionnaire validated in Spanish to establish the risk of obstructive sleep apnea.\n   * Arterial gasometry.\n   * Blood cell count.\n   * Ultrasensitive C-reactive protein.\n   * Determination of IgE.\n   * Spirometry and Exhaled fraction of nitric oxide according to international guidelines.\n4. \\- Intervention: Patients included will be randomized to receive, 4 nights of noninvasive nocturnal positive pressure ventilation with an S Bilevel device with a 12 cmH2O inspiratory pressure and a 4 cmH2O expiratory pressure or a 4 cmH2O Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP), as a control group.\n\n   The equipment will be placed at night ad libitum and retired the following day in the morning, in all cases a VPAP ST S8 RESMED will be used. If the patient needs to increase inspired oxygen fraction it will be performed with nasal tips during the day and a distal oxygen connector at night. In all cases a nasal mask will be used.\n\n   Blood gasometry, blood cell count, CRP, serum IL-4, IL-5, IL-13, IL-17 and IgE, Spirometry and Exhaled fraction of nitric oxide will be repeated at day 4.\n5. \\- Data Analysis A convenience sample of 20 patients was established. A balanced randomization will be performed. The variables were summarized according to their type and distribution. The comparison of dichotomous variables will be performed using Fisher's Exact test. The comparison of independent continuous variables will be carried out with U of Mann Whitney and the related variables will be analyzed with Wilcoxon Related Ranks Test."
