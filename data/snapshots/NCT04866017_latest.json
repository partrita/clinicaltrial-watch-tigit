      "detailedDescription": "The study initiated with Protocol Amendment 1.0 (PA 1; dated on 16 April 2021). In April 2022 Protocol Amendment 2 (PA 2) was implemented. In PA 1, participants with newly diagnosed, histologically confirmed, unresectable locally advanced NSCLC and evaluable PD-L1 expression all comers were enrolled; cCRT was given within the study. In PA 2, the enrollment of the target population was revised into participants with unresectable locally advanced NSCLC whose disease has not progressed after definitive, platinum-based cCRT and with PD-L1 expression on ≥ 1% of tumor cells as assessed by the central lab; cCRT was given outside of the study.\n\nAfter implementation of PA 2, participants who were randomized under PA 1 were given the option to continue assigned study treatment or to discontinue assigned treatment and begin standard of care treatment outside of the study. Participants enrolled under PA 1 were excluded from the primary and secondary analysis specified by PA 2.\n\nThis study was subsequently terminated by the Sponsor prior to enrollment of any participants under PA 2."
