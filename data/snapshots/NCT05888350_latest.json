      "detailedDescription": "Chronic cough is a frequent complaint in respiratory specialists clinic. CVA, UACS, EB, GERC and AC are common causes of chronic cough, among whom, CVA, EB and AC can be classified as corticosteroid responsive cough.\n\nTo recognize the eosinophilic airway inflammation and assess the response of inhaled corticosteroid, induced sputum analysis is the most widely used examination but not all the subjects can provide an suitable sample of sputum for measurements and it's time-consuming.\n\nRecently, blood eosinophils, FeNO and total IgE were detected to be biomarkers of eosinophilic airway inflammation for asthmatics. However, whether can they predict the response to corticosteroid in chronic cough remains uncertain.\n\nThe present prospective, multi-center, randomized placebo-controlled study aims to explore the value of blood eosinophils, FeNO and total IgE in predicting the response to inhaled corticosteroid in patients with chronic cough."
