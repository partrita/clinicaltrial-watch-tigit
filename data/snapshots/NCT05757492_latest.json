Phase 1 (Dose Optimization phase) will explore 2 different dose combinations in participants with advanced/metastatic solid tumors (except pancreatic) and Phase 2 (Indication-specific Expansion phase) will use one selected dose in specific tumor types (non-small cell lung cancer-non squamous \\[NSCLC-NS\\] and Hepatocellular carcinoma \\[HCC\\])",
      "detailedDescription": "The Dose Optimization phase will enroll participants with advanced/metastatic solid tumors (except pancreatic). Up to 20 participants will be randomized into two dosing arms. Two different primary advanced solid tumors have been selected for investigation of antitumor activity in the Indication-specific Expansion phase. Up to 40 participants will be enrolled into each Indication-specific Expansion phase cohort. All participants in both phases will receive CHS-006 in combination with toripalimab intravenously (IV) every 3 weeks (Q3W)."
