      "detailedDescription": "The study is an open randomized controlled study on oral immunotherapy including 60 children (40 on active treatment, 20 controls) with primary peanut allergy. The study has 4 phases: 1: inclusion/randomization including a double blind placebo controlled food Challenge 2: bi weekly up-dosing to maintenance dose after 48 weeks, 3: maintenance period of 3 years 4: 1 year follow up after end of treatment.\n\nClinical parameters as well as immunological (serological and cellular) will be recorded at inclusion, after 3 months of up-dosing, at end of up-dosing, after 1 and 3 years of maintenance treatment and after 3 and 12 year of follow up."
