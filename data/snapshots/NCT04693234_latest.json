Measurable disease as assessed by RECIST v1.1. Note: A lesion in an area subjected to prior loco-regional therapy, including previous radiotherapy, is not considered measurable unless there has been demonstrated progression in the lesion since the therapy as defined by RECIST v1.1.\n4. Participants must submit qualified archival tumor tissue (formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded block containing tumor \\[preferred\\] or approximately 15 \\[at least 6\\] unstained slides) with an associated pathology report, or agree to a tumor biopsy for determination of Programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression and other biomarker analyses (fresh tumor biopsies are strongly recommended at baseline in participants with readily accessible tumor lesions and who consent to the biopsies).\n5. Participant must have adequate organ function as indicated by the screening laboratory values obtained within 7 days before the first study treatment.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n1. Prior therapy with an anti-PD-1, anti-PD-L1, anti-PD-L2, TIGIT or any other antibody or drug specifically targeting T-cell costimulation or checkpoint pathways.\n2. Any active malignancy ≤ 2 years before first dose of study drug except for the specific cancer under investigation in this study and any locally recurring cancer that has been treated curatively (eg, resected basal or squamous cell skin cancer, superficial bladder cancer, carcinoma in situ of breast).\n3. Uncontrollable pleural effusion, pericardial effusion, or ascites requiring frequent drainage (recurrence within 2 weeks of intervention).\n4. Any major surgical procedure ≤ 28 days before first dose of study drug. Participants must have recovered adequately from the toxicity and/or complications from the intervention before the first dose of study drug.\n5. Has received any chemotherapy, immunotherapy (eg, interleukin, interferon, thymosin, etc.) or any investigational therapies within 14 days or 5 half-lives (whichever is longer) before the first dose of study drug or has received palliative radiation treatment or other local regional therapies within 14 days before the first dose of study drug.\n\nNote: Other protocol defined Inclusion/Exclusion criteria may apply",

The participant answers questions about their health during the past week.

The single symptom items include Lymphedema, Peripheral Neuropathy, Menopausal Symptoms, Sexual Worry, Sexual Activity and Sexual Enjoyment.
