Two dosages of omalizumab will be compared to placebo during an oral immunotherapy protocol for three simultaneous food allergens.",
      "detailedDescription": "This is a phase 2b, multi-center randomized controlled trial comparing 2 doses of omalizumab to placebo in subjects 6 to 25 years old with multiple food allergies undergoing a symptom-driven multi-food OIT protocol.\n\nSubjects will undergo a screening period involving a DBPCFC to a mix of three allergens which will determine their eligibility and eliciting dose.\n\nEligible subjects will be randomized to one of 2 omalizumab dosages or placebo at a ratio of 2:2:1 for a total period of 20 weeks.\n\nThey will undergo initial food escalation (IFE) to determine their starting food treatment mix dose for three simultaneous food allergens after a pre-treatment period of 8 weeks with the study drug.\n\nSubjects will undergo up-dosing OIT visits at the clinic every two weeks, until a maintenance dose of 1500mg of protein (500mg per food) is reached (primary endpoint)."
