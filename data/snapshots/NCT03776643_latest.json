      "briefSummary": "Several studies have reported a deficit and/or a defect in regulatory T cells in allergic subjects, which can be correlated with the allergic responses, especially for respiratory allergies. Low-dose IL-2 (ld-IL2) specifically targets and activates regulatory T cells (Tregs), which are cells that regulate immune responses. Thus by stimulating Tregs, ld-IL2 would control allergic responses.\n\nThis study is designed to evaluate the efficacy of ILT-101 (ld-IL-2), compared to placebo, on the nasal response assessed by Total Nasal Symptom Score (TNSS) during a controlled birch allergen exposure.",
      "detailedDescription": "Primary objective To evaluate the efficacy of ILT-101 (ld-IL-2), compared to placebo, on nasal response on day 40\n\nSecondary objectives To evaluate the efficacy of ILT-101 on rhino-conjunctivitis symptoms, on inflammatory mediators, allergic specific immune responses and safety.\n\nExperimental design This is a monocentric, randomized, placebo controlled, double-blind trial in parallel-groups, evaluating a treatment by ILT-101/placebo, 1 MIU daily for 5 days and 1 MIU every week, until day 36.\n\nPopulation involved Male or female, aged between 18 and 55 years, with allergic rhinitis to birch pollen.\n\nNumber of subjects: 24\n\nDuration of patient participation: 3 months (treatment period: 36 days months, follow-up period: 34 days)"
