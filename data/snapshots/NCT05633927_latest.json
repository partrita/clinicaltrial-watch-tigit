      "briefSummary": "Prospective, non-equality, cohort study, where investigators propose to analyze humoral and cellular immunity after two doses of SARS-CoV-2 RNA vaccines in HIV-infected participants severely immunosuppressed.\n\nA total of 92 HIV-infected subjects over 18 years old with ≤200 CD4/μl (experimental group; n=46) and ≥ 350 CD4/μl (as control group; n=46) who have completed two doses vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 will be included in the study.\n\nPrimary Objectives:\n\n* To analyze the percentage of participants with SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG after 1, 6, and 12 months after vaccination in subjects with ≤200 vs ≥350 CD4/μL by electrochemiluminescence immunoassay (Elecsys® Anti-SARS-CoV-2. Roche Diagnostics).\n* To analyze the percentage of subjects with specific T and memory B lymphocyte response against SARS-CoV-2 after 1, 6, and 12 months after vaccination with \\<200 vs ≥350 CD4/μL. Multiparametric flow cytometry in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) will be performed to detect the production of cytokines (IL-2, TNF-α and IFN-γ), cytolytic (perforin and granzyme B) and degranulation (CD107a) molecules from T cells, as well as to identify memory B cells specific to SARS-CoV-2 IgG+.\n\nSecondary Objectives: To analyze in participants with \\<200 vs ≥350 CD4/μl after 1, 6, and 12 months after vaccination:\n\n* Quantification of specific IgG titers against SARS-CoV-2\n* The association of the T response to SARS-CoV-2 with humoral response parameters.\n* The association of the T response against SARS-CoV-2 with other parameters of immune activation, inflammation and immunosenescence. The phenotypes of maturation (CD45RA and CD27), activation (HLA-DR and CD38), senescence (CD57+CD28-) and markers of immune exhaustion (TIGIT, LAG-3, TIM-3 and PD-1) in CD4 and CD8 lymphocytes T will be determined by multiparametric flow cytometry."
