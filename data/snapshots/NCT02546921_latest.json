      "briefSummary": "This first in human study of the new therapeutic antibody MOv18 immunoglobulin (Ig) E, which targets a protein called folate receptor alpha (FRa), in patients with advanced cancer seeks to demonstrate the potential for the use of this IgE antibody as an example of the use of the IgE class of antibodies for the treatment of cancer.",
      "detailedDescription": "Therapeutic antibodies have significantly improved the prognosis of patients with a range of cancers. Currently available therapeutic antibodies belong to the IgG class. This study is looking at a new drug called MOv18 IgE which belongs to a different class of antibody, the IgE class. IgE antibodies may trigger a more powerful immune response to tumour cells than these available IgG antibodies and so be more effective in treating certain types of cancer. This is the first time an IgE antibody therapy will be given to patients with cancer.\n\nThe MOv18 IgE antibody is designed to recognise and attach to FRa. Scientists have found more of this protein on the surface of certain cancer cells than on the surface of normal cells, most commonly ovarian cancer but also cancers of the kidney, endometrium, lung, breast, bladder, colon and pancreas. Once attached, the MOv18 IgE antibody should trigger the body's own immune system to attack and kill the cancer cells.\n\nPatients will be selected based on the presence of FRa on their tumour in a previous biopsy. The study is the first study of this new antibody treatment to be given to humans and will focus primarily on the assessment of safety confirming the findings of preclinical studies that exposure to MOv18 IgE will not trigger anaphylaxis. This is in addition to extensive pharmacokinetic (PK), biodistribution of the antibody and immunological response. The study will follow a dose escalation design where small groups of patients are treated at a set dose, starting with a very low dose followed by exponential increasing doses, to find a safe dose at which the drug has a good chance of effectively treating the cancer. Patients will receive a short course of treatment. Patients treated at the higher dose levels will be asked to provide a pre and post treatment biopsy to explore the effect of the treatment on the tumour."

Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, post-ovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception.\n8. Major thoracic or abdominal surgery from which the patient has not yet recovered.\n9. At high risk from the effects of anaphylaxis because of non-malignant systemic disease including active uncontrolled infection, cardiac failure, peripheral vascular disease, previous cerebrovascular accident (CVA), dyspnoea due to heart failure, extensive lung metastases, significant pleural effusions or other conditions.\n10. History of laryngeal oedema, uncontrolled or high risk asthma (according to Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) guidelines), or anaphylaxis. Patients with a history of hypersensitivity to carboplatin, taxanes, or contrast media may enter the study at the investigator's discretion.\n11. Patients with any congenital or acquired immunodeficiency syndrome or receiving immunosuppressive therapy (including any dose of systemic corticosteroids), or who are immunosuppressed post organ transplant. However, patients receiving inhaled corticosteroids and patients with a history of allergy (other than anaphylaxis) are eligible, as are patients with a history of auto-immune disease.\n12. Known to be serologically positive for hepatitis B, hepatitis C or human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).\n13. Patients with baseline elevation in serum tryptase (indicating possible mastocytosis) or a positive baseline basophil activation test (indicating a hypothetical potential for anaphylaxis with MOv18 IgE).\n14. Participating or planning to participate in another interventional clinical trial, whilst taking part in this study. Participation in an observational study or in the follow-up phase of a previous interventional trial is acceptable.\n15. Any other condition which in the Investigator's opinion would not make the patient a good candidate for the clinical study.\n16. Patients unwilling or unable to interrupt antihistamines (which may interfere with skin prick testing). Antihistamines should be discontinued at least 4 half-lives before the first skin prick test.",
