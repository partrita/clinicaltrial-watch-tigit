The primary hypothesis is that pembrolizumab/vibostolimab is superior to pembrolizumab with respect to RFS as assessed by the investigator in participants with high-risk resected Stage IIB, IIC, III and IV melanoma.",
      "detailedDescription": "With Amendment 4, participants will discontinue treatment with pembrolizumab/vibostolimab.\n\nThe protocol-specified futility analysis of the primary outcome measure was completed with a data cut-off of 06-Mar-2024 (Primary Completion Date) and served as the final analysis of the primary outcome measure. Per protocol, 192 participants enrolled after the primary completion date and will be analyzed in the End of Trial analysis."
