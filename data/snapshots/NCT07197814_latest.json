      "briefSummary": "The goal of this clinical trial is to see if a new formula based on hydrolysed rice proteins (Rice formula) is well tolerated by infants and young children with cow's milk allergy. In case the Rice formula is well tolerated, the formula will be considered \" hypoallergenic \".\n\nThe main question it aims to answer is: Does the Rice formula cause allergic reactions in infants and young children who are allergic to cow's milk? Researchers will compare during a double-blind placebo-controlled food challenge (DBPCFC) the Rice formula to a Placebo formula to see if any allergic symptom appears after feeding with the Rice formula. If children do not show any allergic symptoms during the DBPCFC, they will then be exclusively formula-fed the Rice formula for 7 days.\n\nParticipants will:\n\n* come at the hospital twice (around 7 days apart) for the DBPCFC\n* then, after this procedure, be fed the Rice formula for 7 days, as a replacement for their usual infant formula\n\nTheir parents will pay attention to the appearance of any allergic symptom after each day of the DBPCFC, and during the 7-day feeding period. They will keep a diary of any adverse event in their child, the use of any concomitant treatment, and the introduction in their child's diet of any new allergenic food. In addition, during the 7-day feeding period, they will report quantities of the Rice formula consumed, data on regurgitations/vomiting if any, stool consistency/frequency/colour and their satisfaction."
