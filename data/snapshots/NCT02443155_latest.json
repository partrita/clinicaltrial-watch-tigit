The measurement of perceived benefits of, and barriers to, treatment was achieved by creating a pool 28 statements each with a 7-point scale ranging from strongly agree (6) to strongly disagree (0). ETBB benefits score was calculated using the responses from questions 1, 4, 7, 8, 10, and 12 and ETBB barriers score was calculated using the responses from questions 2, 3, 5, 6, 9, and 11. Both was calculated as the sum of responses divided by number of responses received multiplied by the maximum number of responses. Based on the responses used the maximum responses available was 6. The higher score indicates more perceived benefits or more perceived barrier.",
