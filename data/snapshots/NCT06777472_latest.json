The annual number of flare-up of asthma patients will be used as the main outcome index to evaluate the clinical effect of lung-benefiting moxibustion on reducing exacerbations of asthma. By observing immunoglobulin, T cell subsets and other indicators, the advantage population and mechanism of moxibustion in treating patients with poor asthma control will be clarified."
