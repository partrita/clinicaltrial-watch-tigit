The total daily score (sum of the wheal and pruritus scores) ranges from 0 to 6. Because of variations in chronic urticaria disease intensity, assessment of disease activity was based on a weekly (7 days) UAS score called UAS7, that is, the sum of the daily UASs, ranging from 0 to 42 per week. A higher score indicates worse disease. A negative change score (Week 24 score minus Baseline score) indicates improvement.",

Patients are asked to respond to each of 10 questions on a 4-point Likert scale in regard to how much their skin problem has affected their life over the last week (0=not at all, 1=a little, 2=a lot, 3=very much). The overall (total) DLQI score (range=0 to 30) is calculated by summing the scores of all 10 questions. The higher the score, the more QoL is impaired. A negative change score (Week 24 score minus Baseline score) indicates improvement.",

          "description": "The CU-Q2oL (German version) is a questionnaire that measures the relative burden of chronic urticaria on subjective well-being. It has 23 questions in 3 domains (symptoms, general impairment, difficulties and problems due to urticaria). Patients are asked to respond how much they are troubled by each problem on a 5-point Likert scale (1=not at all to 5=very much). Each domain and the overall (total) scores are normalized to a scale of 1 to 100. A higher score indicates lower QoL. A negative change score (Week 24 score minus Baseline score) indicates improvement.",
