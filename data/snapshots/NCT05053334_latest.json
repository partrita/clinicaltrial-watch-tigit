Subjects who are considered healthy as determined by clinically acceptable findings of hematology, clinical chemistry, coagulation profile, urinalysis, and 12-lead ECG as per investigator's discretion.\n4. Subject must agree to use a highly effective contraception as detailed in Appendix 1(Section 13.1) during the study period (starting from screening visit) and until 9 months after administration of BP11, Xolair® -EU or Xolair® -US by agreeing to use (with their female partner if she is of childbearing potential) 2 acceptable forms of contraception.\n5. Subjects must refrain from donating sperm or fathering a child during the study period (starting from screening visit) and until 9 months after administration of BP11, Xolair®-EU or Xolair®-US administration by agreeing to use (with their female partner if she is of childbearing potential) 2 acceptable forms of contraception.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n1. Known history of hypersensitivity or allergic reactions to omalizumab or any of its excipients.\n2. History of cardiovascular, hepatic, ophthalmic, pulmonary, neurological, metabolic, hematological, gastrointestinal, endocrine, immunological, psychiatric or any other disease which in the opinion of the Investigator would make the subject inappropriate for study participation.\n3. Abnormal and clinically relevant (in the opinion of the Investigator) vital signs, ECG, history of angina, exertional dyspnea, orthopnea, congestive heart failure, or myocardial infarction.\n4. Major surgery or major trauma within past one year of screening or anticipated need for any surgery during the study duration.\n5. Difficulty in blood sampling or difficulty in accessibility of veins.\n6. History of significant alcohol abuse within 1 years prior to screening or regular use of alcohol within 6 months prior to the screening visit (more than 14 units of alcohol per week \\[1 unit = 150 mL of wine, 360 mL of beer, or 45 mL of 40% alcohol\\]).\n7. History of drug abuse within 1 year prior to screening or recreational use of soft drugs (such as marijuana) within 1 month or hard drugs (such as cocaine, phencyclidine \\[PCP\\], crack, opioid derivatives including heroin, and amphetamine derivatives) within 3 months prior to screening.\n8.
