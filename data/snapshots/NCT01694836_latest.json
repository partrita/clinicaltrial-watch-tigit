An SPT is considered positive if it results in a wheal diameter of at least 3.0 mm\n* Internet access so that patients can complete the eDiary daily via internet during all 5 pollen seasons covered by the study protocol.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* History of significant clinical manifestations of allergy as a result of sensitization against co-allergies, particularly-but not limited to-grass or weed pollen and perennial allergens (e.g. house dust mites, cat or dog).\n* History of anaphylactic reaction.\n* Moderate or severe persistent asthma (GINA 3 or 4).\n* Mild persistent asthma (GINA 2), according to the Global Initiative for Asthma Guidelines, necessitating treatment with inhaled glucocorticoids at a daily dose level of \\> 400 µg budesonide dose equivalents.\n* Lung function \\< 80% of the predicted normal value (for PEF: highest result of 3 measurements).\n* Acute or chronic inflammatory or infectious airway diseases including recurrent acute or chronic sinusitis.\n* Chronic structural diseases of the affected organs (e.g. eye, nose, lung).\n* History or presence of confirmed or potential diseases of the immune system including autoimmune diseases and immune deficiencies of actual clinical relevance.\n* Any disease that prohibits the use of adrenaline (e.g. hyperthyroidism).\n* Atopic dermatitis with SCORAD \\>30 in the past or at screening.\n* Ongoing or past full courses of SIT against birch pollen within the last 5 years.\n* Topical and systemic treatment with β-blockers.\n* Concomitant treatment with substances interfering with the immune system beginning 1 week prior to start of treatment.\n* Use of systemic corticosteroids within 3 months prior to Visit 1-1.\n* Immunization with vaccines within 7 days prior to Visit 1-1.\n* Treatment with antihistamines for any reason other than allergic symptoms due to birch pollen allergy.\n* Changed residence between geographical regions since the last birch pollen season or not staying in the geographical region during the pre-determined birch pollen season.\n* Nursing (lactating) women or women with a positive pregnancy test at the screening visit. Women of childbearing potential must be using highly effective contraception during participation in this clinical study. A highly effective method of birth control is defined as one that results in a low failure rate (i.e. less than 1% per year) when used consistently and correctly, such as implants, injectables, combined oral contraceptives, some IUDs, sexual abstinence, or vasectomised partner.",
