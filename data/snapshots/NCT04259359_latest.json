      "briefSummary": "Venom immunotherapy (VIT) is an established treatment for Hymenoptera venom allergy and provides long-term protection from further generalized reactions in almost all patients. However, it is still unclear why bee VIT is less effective than vespid VIT.\n\nThe preliminary data show that not only predominant Api m 10 sensitization but also other predominant sensitizations may be relevant as risk factors for treatment failure. Interestingly, all patients with a predominant Api m 10 sensitization who received bee VIT with a venom preparation with a supposed lack of Api m 10 tolerated sting challenges. Therefore, a multicenter study with a sufficient number of patients with treatment failure is urgently required, to clarify if predominant sensitization to a bee venom allergen is a risk factor for treatment failure.\n\nIf predominant sensitization is a risk factor and caused by underrepresented components in bee venom preparations used for VIT, bee venom preparations may be optimized in the future and patients would benefit from a more effective VIT."
