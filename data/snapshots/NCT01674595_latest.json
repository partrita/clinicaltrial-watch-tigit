The trial will be initiated after olive pollen season 2012 and subjects will receive treatment for 6 weeks.\n\nThe aim of study is to assess the tolerability of the up-dosing phase of AVANZ Olive. The frequency of patients with adverse reactions will be the primary endpoint.\n\nFrequency of patients with systemic reactions according to EAACI classification, increase in IgG4 and in IgE and reduction in immediate skin reactivity."

A positive specific IgE against olive pollen (≥Class 2; ≥0.70 KU/L) documented in the last 5 y\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n1. FEV1 \\< 70% of predicted value at screening after adequate pharmacologic treatment.\n2. Uncontrolled or severe asthma.\n3. A clinically relevant history of symptomatic perennial allergic rhinitis and/or conjunctivitis caused by an allergen to which the subject is regularly exposed and sensitized.\n4. History of severe asthma exacerbation or emergency room visit or admission for asthma in the previous 12 months.\n5. At screening, current symptoms of, or treatment for, upper respiratory tract infection, acute sinusitis, acute otitis media or other relevant infection (serous otitis media is not an exclusion criterion).\n6. Treatment with parenteral corticosteroids, oral corticosteroids or anti-IgE in the previous 3 months or during the study (except for steroids if needed as rescue medication).\n7. Currently treated with angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, tricyclic antidepressants, β-blockers, mono amine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) and any other drug containing alum (e.g. antacids) taken on a daily basis.\n8. Previous treatment by other allergen concomitant IT or immunotherapy with Olea europaea extracts within the previous 5 years (initiation of subcutaneous immunotherapy is acceptable if treatment has been discontinued before reaching maintenance dose; for SLIT 3 months in the last 5 years is accepted).\n9. History of anaphylactic shock due to e.g. food, insect venom, exercise or drug.\n10. History of severe and recurrent angioedema.\n11. Any contraindication according to the Investigator Brochure (IB).\n12. Use of an investigational drug within 30 days prior to screening.",
