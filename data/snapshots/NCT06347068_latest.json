The safety of iC9-CAR.B7-H3 T cells will be investigated using a modified 3+3 design. The data from the dose escalation will be used to determine a recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D), which will be decided based on the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and additional factors such as the ability to manufacture sufficient cells for infusion.\n\nSubjects with TNBC who meet procurement eligibility criteria will have cells collected to manufacture iC9-CAR.B7-H3 T cells. Eligible subjects will receive lymphodepletion with cyclophosphamide and fludarabine."
