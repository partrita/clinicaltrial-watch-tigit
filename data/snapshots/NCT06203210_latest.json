Adults ≥18 years or the minimum legal adult age (whichever is greater) at the time the informed consent form is signed.\n3. Has histologically or cytologically documented extensive-stage small cell lung cancer (ES-SCLC).\n4. The participant must provide adequate baseline tumor samples with sufficient quantity and quality of tumor tissue content.\n5. Has received prior therapy with only one prior platinum-based line as systemic therapy for SCLC with at least 2 cycles of therapy and a chemotherapy free-interval of ≥30 days.\n6.

Has ECOG PS of ≤1 within 7 days prior to Cycle 1 Day 1 (C1D1).\n9. Has no evidence of brain or leptomeningeal disease (spinal cord or central nervous system \\[CNS\\] metastases) based on history and physical examination. Subjects must require no treatment with steroids or anticonvulsants and have a stable neurologic status for at least 2 weeks prior to the first dose of study drug.\n\nExclusion Criteria\n\nParticipants who meet any of the following criteria will be disqualified from entering the study:\n\n1. Has received prior treatment with orlotamab, enoblituzumab, or other B7 homologue 3 (B7-H3) targeted agents, including I-DXd.\n2. Prior discontinuation of an antibody drug conjugate (ADC) that consists of an exatecan derivative (eg, trastuzumab deruxtecan) due to treatment-related toxicities.\n3. Has received any of the comparators used in this study or any topoisomerase I inhibitor.\n4. Has inadequate washout period before randomization as specified in the protocol.\n5. Has any of the following conditions within the past 6 months: cerebrovascular accident, transient ischemic attack, or another arterial thromboembolic event.\n6. Has uncontrolled or significant cardiovascular disease.\n7. Has clinically significant corneal disease.\n8. Has any history of ILD/pneumonitis irrespective of steroid use, or current ILD, or suspected ILD, or ILD that cannot be ruled out by imaging at Screening. Participants may be eligible if they had history of radiation pneumonitis that did not require steroids.\n\n   Examples of suspected ILD/pneumonitis by imaging include the presence of lung parenchymal fibrosis, such as combined pulmonary fibrosis and emphysema (CPFE) and any radiographic features consistent with ILA, including but not limited to, extensive ground glass opacities, reticular opacities, traction bronchiectasis, and honeycombing.\n9.
