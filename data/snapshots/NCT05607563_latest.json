      "detailedDescription": "This is a single-arm, open-label, Phase I study contains dose escalation stage and dose expansion stage.\n\nThe dose escalation stage will be following the accelerated titration design and the classic 3+3 design, with a planned enrollment of 10 to 24 patients with advanced tumors.\n\nThe dose expansion stage will be used safe and tolerable doses, with a planned enrollment of 30 patients with advanced tumors."
