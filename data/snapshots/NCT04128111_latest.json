      "briefSummary": "This study aims to determine the TCM syndrome pattern and the distribution of inflammation phenotype in different stages of bronchial asthma; to explore the correlation between TCM syndrome and inflammation phenotype. Secondly screening biomarkers that can be recognized by TCM syndromes and inflammatory phenotypes of bronchial asthma, and provide a basis for individualized diagnosis and treatment of diseases.",
      "detailedDescription": "The clinical heterogeneity of bronchial asthma was strong.The TCM syndrome was complicated and mostly treated on stage, type, excess and deficiency.The phenotype was numerous and more classified from inflammation type, clinical classification, internal phenotype, etc.The flammatory phenotype was the more common type.The pathological basis of asthma was closely related to the infiltration of inflammatory mediators such as Airway eosinophil cells, so it was important to find the specific biomarker. The correlation between TCM syndrome, inflammatory phenotype and its biomarker wsa not clear. So we put forward theoretical hypothesis:There was of correlation between TCM syndrome and inflammatory phenotype of asthma.The biological target was contributes to the confirmation for TCM syndrome and inflammatory phenotype.The following research was planned to be carried out: relying on the registration system of National TCM Clinical Research Base to enroll in 900 cases patients in the acute and remission period of asthma and healthy physical examination crowd, filling in the patient's general demographic data, disease status, lung function, TCM syndrome and score and collecting the sputum, exhaled gas, urine, peripheral venous serum specimens and biomarker to be tested on the same day. Based on the clinical research database, confirming syndrome and in phenotype, clarifying the correlation between syndrome and phenotype and selecting identifiable biomarker by using correlation analysis, principal component analysis, multiple regression analysis, neural network analysis and other methods.The research provided evidence for the study of the essence of syndrome and phenotype and provided evidence for individualized diagnosis and treatment of diseases."
