During this time, they will attend several study visits, which may include physical examinations, blood collection, skin biopsies, and a mosquito feeding procedure. Study staff will also follow up with participants by phone several times throughout the study."

The fold change from day 1 to day 43 is calculated by dividing the antigen titer for a specific isotype i.e. IFN-gamma at day 43 by the titer at day 1.
