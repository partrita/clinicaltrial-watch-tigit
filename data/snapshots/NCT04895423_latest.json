      "detailedDescription": "This is a prospective study aimed at direct comparative analysis of the efficacy and safety of treatment of children from 6 years of age suffering from moderate and severe atopic dermatitis using a genetically engineered biological drug and classical immunosuppressants.\n\nBased on clinical and anamnestic data, compliance with the inclusion / exclusion criteria, the study included 160 patients from 6 years old, with moderate / severe atopic dermatitis.\n\nThe initial indices were assessed: SCORAD- Scoring of Atopic Dermatitis (index for assessing the severity of atopic dermatitis); NRS- numeric rating scale for itch; CDLQI - The Children's Dermatology Life Quality Index; POEM- Patient-Oriented Eczema Measure (personalized assessment of eczema) and laboratory parameters: alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase, lactate dehydrogenase, gamma-glutamyltransferase, total bilirubin, direct bilirubin, serum albumin, blood urea specific IgE to food and household allergens, indicators of a clinical blood test, indicators of a general analysis of urine, indicators of a biochemical analysis of urine (creatinine, urea).\n\nIn the presence of concomitant allergic pathology (bronchial asthma, allergic rhinitis), the CSMS \\[Combined Symptom and Medication Score\\] were additionally assessed (Scale for assessing nasal symptoms of rhinitis, taking into account the need for medication); VAS - Visual Analog Scale (visual analog scale); ACT- Asthma Control Test. Subsequently, systemic therapy was prescribed: metorexat (40 people), mycophenolate mofetil (40 people), cyclosporine (40 people) dupilumab (40 people)."
