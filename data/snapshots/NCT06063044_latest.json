      "briefSummary": "Allergic diseases in children are major public health concerns due to their widespread and rising prevalence. The most classic pathway to trigger allergy is type I allergy mediated by immunoglobulin E(IgE), but the role of immunoglobulin G4(IgG4) in allergic diseases is still worth exploring.we have collected the data of allergic patients aged 0-14 years for retrospective cross-sectional analysis to evaluate the positive rates of total IgE, HDM IgE, FS-IgE and FS-IgG4. Meanwhile, investigators screened out patients who were treated with FS-IgG4-guided elimination diets with/without probiotics for more than 3 months to clarify the role of FS-IgG4 in childhood allergic diseases by assessing the improvement of clinical symptoms before and after treatment.",
      "detailedDescription": "Allergic diseases in children are major public health concerns due to their widespread and rising prevalence. And management of allergic diseases beyond medication, such as food management is also very important. The most classic pathway to trigger allergy is type I allergy mediated by immunoglobulin E(IgE), but the role of immunoglobulin G4(IgG4) in allergic diseases is still worth exploring.In present study, investigators have collected the data of allergic patients aged 0-14 years for retrospective cross-sectional analysis to evaluate the positive rates of total IgE, house dust mite (HDM) IgE, FS-IgE and FS-IgG4. Meanwhile, investigators screened out patients who were treated with FS-IgG4-guided diet elimination with/without probiotics for more than 3 months to clarify the role of FS-IgG4 in childhood allergic diseases by assessing the improvement of clinical symptoms before and after treatment. This retrospective study was conducted to clarify the clinical relevance of food-specific IgG4 in allergic diseases and the effect of dietary avoidance on clinical symptoms, thus making a breakthrough in the diagnosis and treatment of childhood allergies."
