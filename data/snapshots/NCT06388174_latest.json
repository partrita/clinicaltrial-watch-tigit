      "briefSummary": "The idiopathic generalized epilepsies (IGEs) have historically included the syndromes childhood absence epilepsy (CAE), juvenile absence epilepsy (JAE), juvenile myoclonic epilepsy (JME), and epilepsy with generalized tonic-clonic seizures alone (GTCA). Recognition of the IGEs is important for clinical care, as it informs diagnosis, prevents unnecessary investigation, allows optimal selection of anti-seizure medications (ASMs), and provides prognostic guidance.\n\nAccording to the new ILAE definition in 2022, the study aims to describe the clinical features, electroencephalographic, imaging findings and long-term prognosis.",
