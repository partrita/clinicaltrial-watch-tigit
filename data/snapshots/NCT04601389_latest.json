      "briefSummary": "An open-label, randomized, in parallel groups comparative study of pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, immunogenicity and safety of GNR-044 (JSC \"GENERIUM\", Russian Federation) and Xolair® (\"Novartis Pharma AG\", Switzerland) after single subcutaneous administration in healthy volunteers at 150 mg",
      "detailedDescription": "There is an increasing incidence of bronchial asthma (BA) and other allergic diseases around the world. Bronchial asthma suffers from 4 to 10% of the world population, in Russian Federation, the incidence of BA across the adult population ranges from 2.2 to 5-7%, in the child population is about 10%.\n\nSevere BA is associated not only with frequent hospitalizations and increased mortality but also with high treatment costs.\n\nAs to it, there is a hot button issue of developing new drugs for treating patients not to be achieved effectively with standard therapy. Considering the leading pathogenesis role of IgE-mediated allergy, the use of drugs to block IgE makes it possible to control the disease at the earliest allergic reaction phase of the development. It was shown that the IgE elimination from the mast cells and basophils surface reduced the severity of acute allergic reactions, reduced the allergen-induced late phase of the immune response and infiltration with inflammatory cells. These anti-IgE antibodies effects have been shown in various studies.\n\nOne of these drugs is оmalizumab (Xolair®). The drug has been approved in various countries across the world, including the United States and the European Union for the severe allergic BA and chronic idiopathic urticaria treatment. In the Russian Federation, omalizumab was registered in May 2007.\n\nThe drug GNR-044 (JSC \"GENERIUM\", Russian Federation) is biosimilar to the original drug Xolair®. This study is aimed to compare the safety and pharmacokinetics of the drug GNR-044 (JSC \"GENERIUM\", Russian Federation) and the drug Xolair® in order to register of the drug GNR-044 (JSC \"GENERIUM\", Russian Federation), a lyophilizate for subcutaneous administration, in the Russian Federation."
