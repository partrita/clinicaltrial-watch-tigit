      "briefSummary": "Phase 1b/Phase 2 Umbrella Study; open-label, multi-center, parallel group study.\n\nSasanlimab (a PD-1 antagonist monoclonal antibody) will be combined with a different targeted therapy in each sub-study. Phase1b of each sub-study will evaluate the safety of the combination and select the dose for the Phase 2 portion. Phase 2 of each sub-study will evaluate the anti-tumor activity of the combination.\n\nSub-Study A is active, not recruiting, ongoing participants are still receiving treatment in Phase 1, Phase 2 will not be initiated.\n\nSub-study B is complete. All participants have discontinued treatment and any additional follow up required by protocol.",
      "detailedDescription": "Landscape 1011 is a clinical research study for people with advanced (stage 3b or 4) non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The purpose of this study is to learn if the study medicine (sasanlimab, a type of immunotherapy) along with other study medicines is safe and effective in people with non-small cell lung cancer that has spread outside of the lungs. There are currently two sub-studies using different types of medicines. People in the first sub-study will receive sasanlimab as a subcutaneous (under the skin) injection at the study clinic every 4 weeks. Additionally, they will take targeted cancer therapies encorafenib by mouth once a day and binimetinib by mouth twice a day at home.\n\nPeople in the second sub-study will receive the study medicine sasanlimab as a subcutaneous (under the skin) injection at the study clinic every 3 weeks and will also receive SEA-TGT (an immunotherapy) by infusion every three weeks.\n\nAdditionally, they will take axitinib (a targeted therapy) by mouth twice a day at home.\n\nIn addition to taking the study drugs, participants in the sub-studies will be asked to visit the clinic for health checks. These include health questions, physical examinations, blood and urine samples, and imaging scans. These assessments help the study doctor and team to monitor the participants' safety and well-being, and to see how their cancer is responding to the treatment. Participants will continue in the study until the cancer is no longer responding to the study medicine."
