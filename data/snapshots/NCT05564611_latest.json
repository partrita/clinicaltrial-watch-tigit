      "briefSummary": "This will be a randomized, double blind, two-arm, single dose, parallel group, PK, PD and safety and immunogenicity study in healthy, adult, subjects.\n\nTotal 204 healthy, adult, eligible human subjects (102 in each treatment arm) will be enrolled in the study with their consent. Required \\*standby subjects will also be enrolled to ensure that 204 subjects are dosed in the study.\n\nThe study will be conducted in cohorts; all the study procedures will be identical as mentioned in the protocol for all the cohorts.",
      "detailedDescription": "This will be a randomized, double blind, two-arm, single dose, parallel group, PK, PD and safety and immunogenicity study in healthy, adult, subjects.\n\nThe study objectives will be to compare the pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics (PD) and to evaluate safety and immunogenicity of the Test product Vs. US-LICENSED XOLAIR following single subcutaneous dose in healthy adult subjects.\n\nFor the purpose of this study the following eligibility assessments will be carried out before enrollment / during the study of any volunteer in the study.\n\nAssessment criteria should be fulfilled for volunteers to be enrolled in the study. The screening will be carried out only after taking written informed consent from volunteers. Once the subject becomes eligible, will get randomized to receive either ADL-018 or US-licensed XOLAIR as per the randomization schedule. This will be parallel design so will have only one study period. After dosing, all subjects will go for serial PK sampling as defined in the study protocol. All subjects will be monitored on safety grounds as mentioned in the study protocol."
