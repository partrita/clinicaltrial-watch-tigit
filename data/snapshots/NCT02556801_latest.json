      "briefSummary": "The purpose of this study is to assess safety, tolerability and demonstrate a dose response signal using Total Symptom Score (TSS), based on challenges with grass pollen in an Environmental Exposure Chamber (EEC), followed by estimation of the minimum effective dose of SUBLIVAC FIX Phleum (SP) after 10 months of treatment compared to placebo.\n\nThe study has 4 treatment groups: 3 different doses of SP and placebo will be tested.",
      "detailedDescription": "The current dose range finding study with SP has been designed to test three different concentrations of SUBLIVAC FIX Phleum (SP) that includes 3 doses (10,000 AUN/mL; 40,000 AUN/mL; 80,000 AUN/mL) and placebo to demonstrate a dose response signal and to estimate the minimal effective dose of SP. The study will be conducted in the target population of seasonal allergic subjects in a fully validated Environmental Exposure Chamber (EEC) system. The EEC system is a facility that has temporal uniformity of airborne allergen (pollen) exposure to subjects. Use of the EEC ensures exposure to relatively consistent levels of allergen. This facility has been used in a number of immunotherapy trials and is an improved challenge model of AR compared to the previously used nasal provocation test. Treatment duration of this study is extended to 10 months."

The mean TSS at visit 6 was calculated as an average of all non-missing TSS scores between 1 and 6 hours after start of Environmental Exposure Chamber (EEC) challenge at visit 6. TSS was computed as the sum of individual scores for eight nasal and non-nasal symptoms (rhinorrhea, congestion, sneezing, itchiness, itchy/gritty eyes, tearing/watery eyes, red/burning eyes, and ear/palate itching). Each of eight symptoms was rated on a scale of 0-3 as follows: 0, none; 1, mild; 2, moderate; 3, severe. The range of TSS is from 0 to 24 units on a scale. The highest the score, the more severe symptoms a subject experiences. Negative change of TSS between baseline and visit 6 was expected (reduced symptoms), more negative change at visit 6 versus baseline represents better outcome of the study.",

The mean TNSS at visit 4 will be calculated as an average of all non-missing TNSS between 1 and 6 hours after start of Environmental Exposure Chamber (EEC) challenge at visit 4. The baseline will be calculated as an average of all non-missing TNSS between 1 and 6 hours after start of during EEC challenge at visit 2. TNSS will be computed as the sum of individual scores for four nasal symptoms (running nose, congestion, itchy nose, and sneezing). Each of the four symptoms will be rated on a scale of 0-3 as follows: 0, none; 1, mild; 2, moderate; and 3, severe. The range of TNSS is from 0 to 12 units on a scale. The highest the score, the more severe symptoms a subject experiences. Negative change of TSS between baseline and visit 6 was expected (reduced symptoms), more negative change at visit 4 versus baseline represents better outcome of the study.",
