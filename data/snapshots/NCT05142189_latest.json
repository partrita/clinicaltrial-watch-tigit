Note: Participants newly enrolled in Cohort 1B under protocol v 5.0 and subsequent versions of the protocol must consent to mandatory blood sampling for peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs).\n* Participants who are to start cemiplimab at Cycle 3 must present with PD-L1 expression of tumor proportion score (TPS) greater than or equal to (\\>=) 1% in tumor cells (as determined locally).\n\nCohort 2:\n\n* Participants must present with PD-L1 expression of tumor proportion score (TPS) \\>= 50% in tumor cells (as determined locally prior to inclusion in this trial).\n* Participants must present with progressive disease either\n\n  1. in the advanced or metastasized stage of NSCLC: while on a PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitor therapy or within 6 months of termination of this treatment as first-line treatment. Or\n  2. be refractory to ongoing adjuvant therapy/maintenance treatment after CRT with a PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitor that has been given for at least 3 months in monotherapy (i.e., after an initial combination therapy) before being enrolled into this trial.\n\nCohort 3:\n\n* Participants prior therapy must have included at least a PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitor and a platinum-based chemotherapy regimen (except if a participant is not candidate for a platinum-based chemotherapy and/or PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitor).\n* Participants must present with progressive disease.\n\nCohort 4:\n\n* Participants who are not candidates for chemotherapy as first-line treatment for the advanced or metastasized stage of NSCLC may be enrolled if presenting with PD-L1 expression: TPS \\>= 1% in tumor cells (as determined locally).\n\nCohort 5:\n\n* Participants NSCLC must have been considered unresectable due to participant's condition and/or tumor-related factors and the participants must have undergone chemoradiotherapy before entering the trial.\n\nCohort 6:\n\n* Participants NSCLC must be considered technically and medically resectable.\n* Participants must be considered eligible for neo-adjuvant treatment.\n\nCohort 7:\n\n* Participants prior therapy must have included at least a PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitor and a platinum-based chemotherapy regimen (except if a participant is not a candidate for a platinum-based chemotherapy and/or PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitor). Note 1: Participants may have received prior therapy targeting CTLA-4, lymphocyte-activation gene 3 (LAG-3), T cell immunoglobulin and immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motif \\[ITIM\\] domain (TIGIT), VEGF or VEGF receptor (VEGFR) inhibitor as monotherapy or part of a combination therapy. Note 2: If the participants' prior therapies included a CTLA-4 inhibitor, the participant must be able to tolerate (additional) treatment with the CTLA-4 inhibitor.\n* Participants must present with progressive disease at trial enrollment.\n* Participants must consent to mandatory blood sampling for PBMCs.\n\nCohorts 8 \\& 9:\n\n* Participants prior therapy must have included at least a PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitor and a platinum-based chemotherapy regimen (except if a participant is not a candidate for a platinum-based chemotherapy and/or PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitor).\n* Participants must present with progressive disease at trial enrollment.\n\nCohort 10:\n\n* Participants who are not candidates for chemotherapy as first-line treatment for the advanced or metastasized stage of NSCLC may be enrolled.\n\nCohort 11:\n\n* Participant's NSCLC must have been considered unresectable due to participants condition and/or tumor related factors and the participants must have undergone chemoradiotherapy before entering the trial.\n\nKey Exclusion Criteria:\n\n* Ongoing active systemic treatment against NSCLC.\n* Presence of a driver mutation for which approved target therapies are available except if the participant is not a candidate for the respective targeted therapy.\n* Ongoing or recent evidence (within the last 5 years) of significant autoimmune disease that required treatment with systemic immunosuppressive treatments which may suggest risk for immune-related adverse events. Note: Participants with autoimmune-related hyperthyroidism, autoimmune-related hypothyroidism who are in remission, or on a stable dose of thyroid-replacement hormone, vitiligo, or psoriasis may be included.\n* Current evidence of new or growing brain or spinal metastases during screening. Participants with leptomeningeal disease are excluded. Participants with known brain or spinal metastases may be eligible for all Cohorts, except for Cohorts 5, 6 and 11, if they:\n* had radiotherapy or another appropriate therapy for the brain or spinal metastases, AND\n* have no neurological symptoms that can be attributed to the current brain lesions, AND\n* have stable brain or spinal disease on the computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan within 4 weeks before signing the informed consent (confirmed by stable lesions on two scans at least 4 weeks apart), AND\n* do not require steroid therapy for the treatment of brain or spinal metastases within 14 d before the first dose of trial treatment. Note: Spinal bone metastases (that is, of the vertebrae) are allowed, unless imminent fracture or cord compression is anticipated.\n* Systemic immune suppression:\n* Current use of chronic systemic steroid medication (\\<= 5 mg/day prednisolone equivalent is allowed); participants using physiological replacement doses of prednisone for adrenal or pituitary insufficiency are eligible. Note: Steroid medication given for supportive or prophylactic reasons during CRT for participants in Cohorts 5 and 11 needs to be tapered to \\<= 5 mg/day prednisolone equivalent at latest on the day before the trial treatment starts.\n* Other clinically relevant systemic immune suppression within the last 3 months before trial enrollment.\n* Known history of seropositivity for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) with CD4+ T-cell (CD4+) counts less than (\\<) 350 cells/microlitre (mcL) and with a history of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS)-defining opportunistic infections.\n* Prior splenectomy.\n* History/risk of interstitial lung disease or low baseline lung function (baseline pulse oximetry of less than 92% oxygen saturation \\[SpO2\\] without additional oxygen).\n\nNOTE: Other protocol defined Inclusion/Exclusion criteria may apply to all or some participants depending on the cohort.",
