      "briefSummary": "Current treatments for lateral epicondylitis include: rest, behaviour modification and physiotherapy, anti-inflammatory medication - both steroidal and non-steroidal, and surgery. Current experimental therapies include muscle relaxants to reduce muscle tone and force on the epicondyle, laser therapy to stimulate collagen production, and blood based therapies including the injection of autologous blood and protein rich plasma.\n\nCell Therapy Ltd (trading as Celixir) has developed a regenerative gel that combines isolated allogeneic platelet growth factors and a cellulose-derivative gel.",
      "detailedDescription": "Lateral epicondylitis, also called \"tennis elbow\" is a common condition affecting 1 to 3% of the population; most commonly individuals aged 35 to 55 years. It is frequently self limiting but can lead to refractory symptoms in a minority of cases. Pain is localised to the lateral epicondyle of the elbow at the point of insertion of the common extensor tendon. Although associated with repetitive movement of the extensor muscles of the forearm, frequently no precipitating cause can be discerned.\n\nThe term \"epicondylitis\" is a misnomer as histological investigations have revealed that there is only limited inflammation, and the term \"epicondylosis\" should be employed, due to the degenerative nature of the condition.\n\nThe condition is divided in to 4 stages, though progression may not occur through all four. Firstly, there is acute inflammation that is quick to resolve. Secondly, prolonged injury results in an increase in fibroblasts, vascular hyperplasia, disorganised collagen disposition and degeneration of the tendon. Thirdly, further accumulation of structural alterations leads to partial or complete tendon rupture. Stage 4 exhibits the same features as 2 and 3 but with the addition of calcification.\n\nCurrent treatments for lateral epicondylitis include: rest, behaviour modification and physiotherapy, anti-inflammatory medication both steroidal and non-steroidal, and surgery. Current experimental therapies include muscle relaxants to reduce muscle tone and force on the epicondyle, laser therapy to stimulate collagen production, and blood based therapies including the injection of autologous blood and protein rich plasma. Trials of the latter two treatments give conflicting results due to variations in protocol and trial design.\n\nCell Therapy Ltd has developed a regenerative gel, Tendoncel, that combines isolated platelet growth factors and cellulose-derivative gel. Tendoncel consists of a proprietary platelet lysate formulation that is easy to apply to the skin."
