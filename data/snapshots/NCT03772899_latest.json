      "briefSummary": "Immunotherapy has helped many cancer patients in the last 5 years by enhancing a patient's immune system to fight cancer. Anti-Programmed Death (PD-1) immunotherapy drugs such as pembrolizumab and nivolumab remove the breaks from cancer-fighting immune cells and have been effective in treating some melanoma patients. Despite the major breakthrough of immunotherapy in oncology treatment, many patients do not respond to this new class of anti-cancer drugs. Recently, evidence suggests that the microorganisms living in a patient's intestines play a major role in modifying the response to anti-PD-1drugs. Patients who respond to these drugs have a unique and healthy group of microorganisms in their gut. Therefore, positive modification of a cancer patient's gut microorganisms to create a more diverse and healthy microbiome may improve the response to immunotherapy. One method of modifying the microbiome is Fecal Microbial Transplantation (FMT) that is already being successfully used in the clinic to treat non-cancer patients with persistent bacterial infections.\n\nIn this study, the investigators will combine FMT with the approved immunotherapy drugs pembrolizumab or nivolumab that are the standard of care for the treatment of advanced melanoma. The purpose of this study is to examine the safety of combining these two therapies in melanoma patients. The investigator will use fecal material from a healthy donor selected via our stringent protocol that is Health Canada approved. In addition to assessing the safety of the combination, the investigator will also study the effect of FMT on the immune system and microbial ecosystem of the gut."
