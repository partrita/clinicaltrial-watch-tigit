      "briefSummary": "All children sensitized to lupine who have performed an oral food challenge (OFC) to lupine between January 2017 and May 2024 in the Pediatric Allergy Unit of the University Hospital of Nancy were included. Retrospective data regarding food and respiratory allergies were collected as well as information regarding lupine skin prick test (SPT), specific IgE (sIgE) and OFC. Severity of allergic reaction was evaluated by CoFAR grade and reactogenic cumulative threshold dose.\n\nAims of this study were (i) to assess relevance of sensitization to lupine in children and (ii) to describe severity of reactions in case of allergy."
