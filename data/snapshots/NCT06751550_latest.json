      "briefSummary": "This study investigates the use of fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO) measurement to monitor non-pharmacological therapy during a three-week inpatient rehabilitation programme for asthma patients. It compares FeNO levels (measured three times a day) with clinical parameters and quality of life to analyse daily fluctuations and the acute effect of exercise training on FeNO levels. As FeNO is a non-invasive biomarker of airway inflammation, this study aims to expand its role in therapy monitoring and explore its application in a rehabilitation setting."
