      "briefSummary": "This is an open-label, multicenter Phase 1b clinical study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, immunogenicity and preliminary efficacy of HC006 in combination with a PD-1 inhibitor in patients with advanced solid tumors. The trial is divided into two stages: dose-escalation and dose expansion. First, the dose-escalation study is completed to determine the recommended dose for subsequent extension studies, and then the dose expansion study is conducted in the proposed tumors with potential treatment benefits.",
      "detailedDescription": "HC006 is an IgG1 monoclonal antibody targeting CCR8, which can specifically clear CCR8-positive tumor infiltrating Treg cells without affecting CD8+ T cell function, thus enhancing the anti-tumor immune response. It has a synergistic effect on anti-tumor effects when combined with PD-1 inhibitors. Based on the existing evidence-based medicine, HC006 combined with PD-1 inhibitors is expected to provide additional treatment benefits in addition to PD-1 inhibitors for a variety of malignant solid tumors including colorectal cancer, head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, gastric cancer, non-small cell lung cancer, cervical cancer, breast cancer, esophageal cancer, pancreatic cancer, ovarian cancer, melanoma, urothelial cancer and renal cancer."
