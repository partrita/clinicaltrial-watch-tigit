      "briefSummary": "The aim of this study is to comprehensively understand the disease control and management status of children with asthma in China, as well as the types of airway inflammation. The findings of this survey will help improve the asthma control level in Chinese children, facilitate future patient education, and guide rational medication use. Moreover, it will provide important evidence for health decision-making departments to better allocate and utilize medical resources.",
      "detailedDescription": "Bronchial asthma (hereinafter referred to as asthma) is the most common chronic respiratory disease in children. It severely affects the physical and mental health of children and imposes a huge economic burden on families and society, consuming a large amount of medical and health resources. In recent years, the prevalence of asthma in children worldwide has generally continued to rise. Data from the Global Burden of Disease database in 2019 showed that the prevalence of asthma in children aged 0-9 years was 4.21%, in children aged 10-14 years was 4.10%, and in adolescents aged 15-19 years was 3.00%. In China, over the past 20 years, the prevalence of asthma in children has also shown an overall upward trend, increasing from 0.91% in 1990 to 1.54% in 2000, and then to 3.02% in 2010. Thanks to the continuous efforts of several generations of pediatricians, the level of standardized diagnosis and treatment of childhood asthma has significantly improved. However, the control of asthma in children still faces many challenges.\n\nThe purpose of this study is to comprehensively understand the disease control and management status of children with asthma in China, as well as the types of airway inflammation. The findings of this survey will help improve the asthma control level in Chinese children, facilitate future patient education, guide rational medication use, and provide important evidence for health decision-making departments to better allocate and utilize medical resources."
