      "briefSummary": "The PEPITES study evaluates the efficacy and safety of Viaskin Peanut 250 µg peanut protein to induce desensitization to peanut in peanut-allergic children 4 through 11 years of age after a 12-month treatment by epicutaneous immunotherapy (EPIT).",
      "detailedDescription": "This is a 12-month, Phase III, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized study to assess the efficacy and safety of Viaskin Peanut, dosed at 250µg peanut protein (per patch) in peanut-allergic children from 4 through 11 years of age.\n\nThe overall maximum study duration for each subject is approximately 61 weeks (6-week screening period, 12-month treatment period and 2-week follow-up period).\n\nDuring the screening period, subjects will undergo a first screening visit and an entry double-blind, placebo-controlled food challenge (DBPCFC) to peanut to confirm their allergy and their entry peanut eliciting dose (ED). The starting dose of the challenge will be 1 mg peanut protein and will escalate up to a highest dose of 300mg peanut protein. Subjects who react at or below the dose of 300mg peanut protein are considered eligible.\n\nRandomization of eligible subjects will occur in a 2:1 ratio to Viaskin Peanut dosed at 250µg peanut protein (active treatment) or placebo. Subjects will be stratified at randomization by their entry/screening DBPCFC ED in 1 of the following 2 strata and by study center:\n\n* Stratum 1: children with a screening ED of 1mg, 3mg or 10mg;\n* Stratum 2: children with a screening ED of 30mg, 100mg or 300mg.\n\nSubjects will apply a Viaskin patch containing either peanut protein or placebo daily for a period of 12 months. At Month 12, a post-treatment DBPCFC to peanut will be performed, with a starting dose of 1 mg peanut protein with escalation up to a highest dose of 2,000 mg peanut protein. This evaluation will help determine the primary efficacy endpoint of this pivotal study."
