      "briefSummary": "Allergen-specific immunotherapy (ASIT) is commonly used to treat patients with allergic rhino-conjunctivitis and asthma, and it is the only proven treatment that affects the long-term development of allergic rhinitis and asthma. The current treatment regime of ASIT requires numerous subcutaneous allergen injections and takes several years to complete. Hence, there is a need to develop more convenient protocols for induction of allergen tolerance.\n\nEmerging evidence suggest that by targeting of antigen presenting cells within the lymph nodes the immunogenicity of the allergen can be enhanced and the number of injections can be reduced.\n\nThe purpose of this study is to evaluate whether intralymphatic administration of ASIT is a safe and effective treatment for patients with pollen-induced allergic rhinitis. The long term goal is to provide a base for a more efficient administration of ASIT, which will reduce both the dose necessary and the number of clinic visits associated with the conventional subcutaneous ASIT.\n\nThe investigators will make an attempt to reproduce the results of a recent human study of intralymphatic ASIT (clinicaltrials.gov; NCT00470457) in a Swedish clinical setting.\n\nThe first part of the study is completed and published (PMID: 23374268)",
      "detailedDescription": "In the first part of the study safety and clinical efficacy of ALK Alutard Birch or 5-grass have been evaluated in a RCT with 50 patients. Active patients recieve 3 injections with 1000 SQ-U ALK Alutard or 5-grasses in a lymph node in the groin. Dose interval 4 weeks. This part of the study is completed and published (PMID: 23374268)\n\nIn the second part of the study 60 patients participates in a RCT with intralymphatic injections with both ALK Alutard Birch AND ALK Alutard 5-grasses. The injections are given intralymphatically with one allergen in each groin with 30 minutes observation between injections. Dose and dose interval are the same as in the first part of the study; the active group recieves 1000 SQ-U ALK Alutard Birch in right groin and 1000 SQ-U 5-grasses in left groin. The injections are given 3 times with 4 weeks interval. Enrollment and treatment is completed and the results will be evaluated in the autumn 2015."
