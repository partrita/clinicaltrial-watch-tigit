      "briefSummary": "The environment during the prenatal period and in early life is a major contributor to the risk of developing childhood asthma. Birth cohort studies from single research centers have identified several factors that affect the risk for developing childhood asthma, including being exposed in early life to allergens, pollutants, viruses and bacteria, and psychosocial stress. Despite such advances, further progress in understanding the root causes of asthma have been hampered by the small size of previous studies, which makes it difficult to: 1) identify asthma risk factors with certainty, 2) know how environmental factors across the United States (U.S.) affect asthma, and 3) whether there are critical ages when pregnant mothers, infants and young children are particularly susceptible to these influences. Furthermore, different research groups tend to use different methods to study asthma, making it difficult to either compare or pool findings. One other challenge is that there are several types (i.e. phenotypes, endotypes) of childhood asthma, but these are poorly understood. To help overcome these challenges, investigators leading 12 asthma birth cohorts across the U.S. have established the Children's Respiratory Research Workgroup (CREW) consortium. CREW proposes to identify specific types of childhood asthma, develop an understanding of what early life environmental influences cause these different types of asthma and when, and identify targets for future efforts aimed at preventing childhood asthma.",
      "detailedDescription": "CREW is an NIH-funded project consisting of 12 individual U.S. birth cohorts and two scientific centers working together to identify phenotypes and causes of childhood asthma. CREW will include data from a large number of children (over 9,000 at birth, 6,000-7,000 who are still being followed, and at least 5,667 expected to enroll in CREW) and their families, with broad diversity in terms of ethnicity, family characteristics, neighborhoods and geographic locations. One of the primary goals of CREW is to put together sets of data and samples of participating cohorts to identify phenotypes of childhood asthma (i.e. specific subtypes of asthma that can be distinguished by clinical features such as natural history, triggers, exacerbation frequency, concurrent allergies, lung function, sex, etc). As we obtain mechanistic insights about personal and early life risk factors, we will connect asthma phenotypes with underlying causes and pathogenic mechanisms to define endotypes of childhood asthma."
