      "briefSummary": "High-dose interleukin 2 (Proleukin, Novartis) (IL-2) is approved by the U.S Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of metastatic kidney cancer and is a standard treatment of this disease. At the present time, IL-2 is the only therapy for kidney cancer that can produce a remission of disease that lasts after treatment is completed. However, most patients who receive IL-2 do not benefit and all patients experience potentially dangerous side effects.\n\nRecent research has suggested that certain patients may respond better to IL-2 than others. The Cytokine Working Group is currently conducting a clinical trial that aims to identify and confirm this research and narrow the application of IL-2 to those patients most likely to benefit.",
      "detailedDescription": "OBJECTIVES:\n\nPrimary\n\n* To determine, in a prospective fashion, if the response rate to high-dose IL-2 for patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma and \"good\" pathologic predictive features is significantly higher than a historical, unselected patient population.\n\nSecondary\n\n* To determine, in a prospective fashion, the response rate to high-dose IL-2 for patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma and \"poor\" pathologic predictive features and to compare this response rate to the response rate of patients with \"good\" pathologic predictive features.\n* To determine if components of other predictive and prognostic models (e.g MSKCI or UCLA criteria) can help to further define the optimal population to receive high-dose IL2 for metastatic renal cell carcinoma.\n* To identify features of the baseline immune function (arginine, arginase, T cell zeta chain) of patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma that are associated with response to high-dose IL-2.\n* To identify new proteins or patterns of gene expression that might be associated with high-dose IL-2 responsiveness in order to further narrow the application of IL-2 therapy to those who will benefit the most."
