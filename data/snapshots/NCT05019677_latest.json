      "briefSummary": "This is an open label, multi-center, phaseⅡstudy to evaluate the efficacy and safety of GP (Gemcitabine/Cisplatin) in combination with Tislelizumab and Ociperlimab as first-line treatment in participants with unresectable advanced Biliary Tract Carcinoma (BTC).",
      "detailedDescription": "Biliary Tract Carcinoma (BTC) have insidious onset, invasiveness, high malignancy, and no specific symptoms in the early stage, and most of them are in the middle and advanced stages at the time of diagnosis and have lost the chance of surgery. For patients with advanced BTC, systemic therapy is currently the main choice, and gemcitabine/cisplatin (GP) is currently the \"gold standard\" for first-line treatment of advanced BTC, but the efficacy is still unsatisfactory, and more and more clinical practice has found that GP-based combination therapy may have better efficacy.\n\nPrevious studies have shown that chemotherapy can improve the immunotherapy microenvironment and may have a synergistic anti-tumor effect in combination with immunotherapy. This study is to explore the efficacy and safety of GP in combination with anti-PD1 antibody (Tislelizumab) and anti-TIGIT antibody (Ociperlimab) as first-line treatment in participants with unresectable advanced BTC."
