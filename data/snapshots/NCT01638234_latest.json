      "briefSummary": "Sleep disturbance is a common complaint among patients with atopic dermatitis(AD). Melatonin may aid sleep and also has anti-inflammatory properties, and has been suggested in managing sleep disturbance in AD patients. However, there has been no large randomized controlled trials. Hence the objective of this double-blind randomized controlled study is to determine whether supplementing melatonin is effective in improving sleep problems in children with AD."
