      "briefSummary": "Aim of this study is to use the major allergen 1 of birch-tree pollen (Bet v 1, Betula verrucosa, synonymous Betula pendula), to investigate the contribution of immunoglobulin E (IgE)- versus non-IgE-mediated mechanisms to chronic skin inflammation in atopic dermatitis patients.",
      "detailedDescription": "In this study non-IgE-reactive recombinant Bet v 1 (rBet v 1) fragments (F1: aa 1-74; F2: aa 75-160) and the fully IgE-reactive recombinant Bet v 1 (aa 1-160)will be used for skin prick testing and atopy patch testing in birch pollen allergic patients with birch pollen induced exacerbation of atopic dermatitis. For control purposes birch pollen allergic patients without birch pollen-induced atopic eczema, persons with allergies other than to birch and non-allergic people will be tested.\n\nThe individuals will be subjected to in vivo skin prick and atopy patch testing with rBet v 1, rBet v 1 fragment 1, rBet v 1 fragment 2 and an equimolar mix of the rBet v 1 fragments. In parallel, the IgE reactivity, and in vitro T cell proliferation, and cytokine production will be studied. Those analyses should help to determine the relevance of IgE mediated mechanisms to chronic skin inflammation and T cell proliferation in AD patients.\n\nA staining for the surface markers chemokine receptor (CCR4)+ and cutaneous lymphocyte antigen (CLA)+ which reportedly are enriched in inflamed skin will further allow to investigate whether patients with high numbers of T lymphocytes expressing CCR4 and CLA tend to exhibit stronger skin inflammation. Moreover, allergen-specific antibody and T cell responses will be analyzed 6-8 weeks after the epicutaneous allergen application."
