      "briefSummary": "Allergen-specific immunotherapy (SIT), the administration of gradually increasing quantities of an allergen extract to an allergic patient, is a curative approach which directly treats the underlying allergic disease. Tree MATA MPL has been developed to provide pre-seasonal specific immunotherapy for patients with an allergy to tree pollen (hay fever).\n\nThe purpose of this double-blind Phase IIb study is to assess the tolerability and immunogenicity of different doses of Tree MATA MPL in volunteers allergic to birch, hazel and alder pollen.",
      "detailedDescription": "Tree MATAMPL (tyrosine adsorbed tree pollen allergoid with monophosphoryl lipid A (MPL®)) has been developed to provide pre-seasonal specific immunotherapy for patients with proven type I hypersensitivity to cross-reacting tree pollens that cause rhinitis and/or conjunctivitis with or without mild to moderate asthma.\n\nThis was a phase IIb, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to assess the tolerability and immunogenicity of different doses of Tree MATA MPL in volunteers allergic to birch, hazel and alder pollen.\n\nSixty eight (68) volunteers were randomly assigned to one of three active treatments or placebo to receive up to 4 subcutaneous injections of either increasing doses of Tree MATAMPL or Placebo over 7 day (+1 day) interval.\n\nThe duration of the study from screening (Visit 1) to end of study (Visit 6, Post-Treatment Visit) was approximately 50 days."
