      "detailedDescription": "The study consists of Dose Escalation Phase, Dose Expansion Phase and Clinical Exploration Phase.\n\nDose Escalation Phase：This phase is an open-label, non-randomized, multicenter, dose-escalation study. From the starting dose of 0.01 mg/kg, an accelerated titration combined with a \"3+3\" design will be adopted.\n\nDose Expansion Phase：The application of Dose Expansion Phase can be discussed by investigator and sponsor based on data obtained in Dose Escalation Phase. This phase is an open-label, non-randomized, multicenter study. 6 patients with locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors are expected to be enrolled at DRDE. Each treatment cycle is defined as 21 days, patient may receive treatment until withdrawal or Treatment Discontinuation.\n\nClinical Exploration Phase：After completing the dose escalation and expansion studies, the indication and study population can be discussed by the investigator and sponsor based on the efficacy and safety data that have been obtained."
