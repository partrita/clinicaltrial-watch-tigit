The dose of MGC026 will be assigned at the time of enrollment. Participants may receive up to 35 treatments if there are no severe side effects and as long as the cancer does not get worse. Participants will be monitored for side effects, and progression of cancer, have blood samples collected for routing laboratory work, and blood samples collected for research purposes."
