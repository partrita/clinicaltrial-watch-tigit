In general, Amgen does not grant external requests for individual patient data for the purpose of re-evaluating safety and efficacy issues already addressed in the product labelling. Requests are reviewed by a committee of internal advisors. If not approved, a Data Sharing Independent Review Panel will arbitrate and make the final decision. Upon approval, information necessary to address the research question will be provided under the terms of a data sharing agreement. This may include anonymized individual patient data and/or available supporting documents, containing fragments of analysis code where provided in analysis specifications.

The HSS and ISS are combined to give a daily UAS ranging from 0 to 6. The sum of the daily UAS over a 7-day period provides the UAS7, from 0 (no symptoms) to 42 (severe urticaria). The least squares mean (LSM) estimates are based on the repeated measure model with stratification factor (prior anti-IgE status), baseline UAS7, treatment, study week and the interaction between treatment and study week. A negative change from baseline indicates an improvement in urticaria activity.",
