      "briefSummary": "40 allergic rhinitis patients in the acute phase will be enrolled in the study. All the allergic patients should be confirmed those who are over 20 years old and hypersensitive to house dust mite allergens confirmed by MAST test before study. All patients were treated with mixed formula of Chinese medicine for one months.",
      "detailedDescription": "Perennial allergic rhinitis is an important disease in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) due to its high prevalence rate in Taiwan. In our previous studies, a new mixed formula of Chinese herbs was evaluated for the treatment of allergic rhinitis. In these studies, we found that immunoduoatory effects of Chinese medicine include: CD4+ T lymphocytes; Regulatory T cells; Dendritic cells, and Regulatory B cells. These results allow us to confirm the immunomodulatory effects of mixed formula of traditional Chinese medicine. In recent years, more and more attention has been paid to the effects of gut microbiota on immune-modulation. Many immunomodulaotry effects of allergic diseases were considered to be closely related to gut bacteria. However, the research on allergic rhinitis is still rare, especially related to TCM treatment. From our previous studies, it has been confirmed that TCM have an immunomodulatory effect on allergic rhinitis. Whether or not they are associated with gut microbiota changes is still unknown. This year, we compared the difference of composition and diversity of gut microbiota of allergic rhinitis patients and normal individual. Indeed, we found it were different between allergic patients and normal individuals. The results of this study will provide us the information to understand whether the immunemodulation of TCM treatment on allergic rhinitis is correlated with the changes of gut microbiota."
