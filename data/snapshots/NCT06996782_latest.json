Part A consisting of one of more safety run-in cohorts to evaluate 2 or more dose levels to identify the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) unless RP2D has been established then Part A will not be required; and\n2. Part B consisting of one or more expansion cohorts.\n\nThe originally planned Sub-study 1 was withdrawn (cancelled) and will not be conducted.\n\nSub-study 2 will evaluate the safety, tolerability, and anti-tumour activity of rilvegostomig plus standard of care (SoC) platinum-based chemotherapy, with or without ramucirumab."
