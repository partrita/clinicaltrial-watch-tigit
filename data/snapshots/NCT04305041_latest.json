The larger study is the umbrella study.\n\nThe goal of substudy 02A is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of investigational treatment arms in participants with PD-1 refractory melanoma to identify the investigational agent(s) that, when used in combination, are superior to the current treatment options/historical control available.\n\nAs of Amendment 4 (effective date: 05JAN2022), a third arm has been opened to participant enrollment, treatment with pembrolizumab and all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA). Enrollment into the first two arms, treatment with pembrolizumab + quavonlimab+ vibostolimab and treatment with pembrolizumab + quavonlimab + lenvatinib has been completed per protocol as of September 2021."
