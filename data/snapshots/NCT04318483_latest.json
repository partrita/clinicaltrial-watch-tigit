      "briefSummary": "Cow milk allergy is one of the most frequent food allergy among children. Cow milk protein's avoidance is needed until spontaneous recovery during the two first years of life. A atypical clinical form with angio-oedema of hands and feet which is associated with high rate of lactoserum's IgE might be a hope of an earlier recovery.",
      "detailedDescription": "Cow Milk allergy is one of the most frequent pediatric food allergy and occurs during the first months of life. It is due to an inappropriate reaction of immune system against the human body. Its treatment is the avoidance of the cow milk proteins. Its spontaneous recovery occurs mostly during the first years of life with the decreasing of the specific IgE and the clinical tolerance to cow milk proteins.\n\nTwo shorts cas reports (3 and 5 patients) have described a clinical form of IgE-mediated cow milk allergy with angio-oedema of hands and feet. This clinical form is associated with more increasing of specific IgE against lactoserum proteins than caseine's. However it has been showed that casein is a marker of cow milk allergy persistence. It might be possible that this atypical form of cow milk allergy progresses favorably towards a restoration of tolerance earlier than the clinical form without angio-oedema of the extremities"
