      "briefSummary": "Severe asthma is a heterogeneous disease characterized by the need for treatment with high doses of inhaled corticosteroids. It affects 5%-10% of asthmatic patients, although it accounts for a significant percentage of the consumption of health care resources. Severe asthma comprises various clinical and pathophysiological phenotypes. In this current study, we aimed to clinical characteristics and cytokes profile in severe asthma patients.",
      "detailedDescription": "To investigate the clinical phenotypes and inflammatory endotype by analyzing cytokines in severe asthma patients, it may improve characterization of the disease and contribute to improved selection of appropriate treatment. It could also help link genotypes with their phenotypic manifestations and their natural history and prognosis. A greater understanding of the phenotypes of severe asthma could enable identification of biomarkers for each phenotype, and identify the association between biokarkers and clinical outcomes in severe asthma patients."
