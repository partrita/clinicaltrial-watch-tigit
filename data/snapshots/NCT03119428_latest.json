      "briefSummary": "The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of OMP-31M32 as a single agent or in combination with nivolumab. OMP-313M32 is an experimental anti-TIGIT antibody that was developed to block TIGIT from binding PVR allowing the body's T-cells to destroy cancer cells.",
      "detailedDescription": "This is an open-label, Phase 1a/b dose escalation study of OMP-31M32 administered as a single agent or in combination with nivolumab to evaluate the safety, tolerability pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics in patients with locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors. This study consists of a screening period, a treatment period and a post-treatment follow-up period in which patients will be followed for survival for up to 2 years. Subjects will be enrolled in two stages in the Phase 1a (dose escalation and expansion) and one stage in the Phase 1b (dose escalation)."
