      "briefSummary": "Nitric oxide (NO) was considered as a mediator of nasal inflammation and the measurement of nasal nitric oxide (nNO) may assist in the diagnosis of nasal inflammation. Few data exists comparing nNO with established, larger accepted reference standard for chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) diagnosis. Moreover, the role of atopic status on nNO in nasal inflammatory diseases has not been reported. The aim of our study was to determine the value of nNO in patients with chronic nasal inflammation, and to assess the relationship between nNO and atopic status in these patients. A total of 131 randomized patients suffering form chronic nonallergic nasal inflammation and 20 healthy volunteers were finally recruited. nNO was measured by NIOX devices. Sinus computed tomography (CT) scan, nasal endoscope and nasal symptoms evaluation were used in the different diagnosis of chronic rhinitis (CR), CRS without nasal polyps (CRSsNP) and CRS with nasal polyps (CRSwNP). Atopic status was confirmed by skin prick test and serum IgE levels. Blood eosinophils were evaluated simultaneously. Relationships among nNO, various atopic characteristics and chronic nasal inflammation were evaluated."

After application of the exclusion criteria, the study was discussed with 410 consecutive patients with a primary diagnosis of chronic nonallergic nasal inflammation. Of these, 214 agreed to take part in, of which 83 were excluded (57 diagnosed as other nasal diseases such as fungal sinusitis, inverted papilloma and so on, 20 with obviously medicine history in the latest two weeks, and 6 refused to continue). Thus, 131 patients were randomized for inclusion and 20 normal adults were recruited as well in our study.",
