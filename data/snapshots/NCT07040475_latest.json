The focus is on the TCIM centers at Immanuel Krankenhaus Berlin, Klinikum Bamberg und Evang. Kliniken Essen-Mitte, where inpatient TCIM therapies are to be systematically evaluated. This form of therapy, which is reimbursed by statutory health insurance providers (under certain conditions), is based on a combination of various evidence-based TCIM approaches. These include hyperthermia, exercise therapy, Mind-Body Medicine, phytotherapy, nutritional therapy, fasting therapy inter alia."
