In addition, the study will determine the current level of asthma control and quality of life in these patients; describe the exacerbation patterns; and determine the current levels of blood eosinophils for the enrolled patients.",
      "detailedDescription": "The primary objective of this study is to describe the treatments patterns of severe asthmatic patients across four Gulf countries during the past year.\n\nSecondary Objectives\n\n1. To determine the current level of asthma control in these patients. In addition, a comparison of uncontrolled asthma between those with a eosinophilic count ≥ 300 cell/μl and those with an elevated eosinophilic count less than that.\n2. To determine the current and past year levels of blood eosinophils, and the percentage of patients with elevated eosinophilic level ≥ 150 cells/μL and ≥ 300 cells/μL\n3. To describe the frequency of exacerbations during the past year.\n4. To assess the current quality of life (QoL) of these patients.\n5. To determine the past year levels of serum IgE.\n6. Exploratory objective: To determine the past year levels of other inflammatory biomarkers like periostin and fraction of exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO)."
