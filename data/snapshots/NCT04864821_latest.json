      "briefSummary": "Cd276 (B7-H3) is an ideal target for car-t treatment because of its high expression on the surface of neuroblastoma, osteosarcoma, gastric cancer and lung cancer cells, but not in normal peripheral cells or tissues. In conclusion, car-t cell therapy has achieved exciting results in blood tumors, but it has been stopped in solid tumor. The main reason for the poor effect is the existence of tumor microenvironment of solid tumor, which inhibits the chemotaxis and infiltration of car-t cells to tumor site. Therefore, in this clinical experiment, we will explore the best model of car-t therapy for solid tumor by intravenous and local tumor injection, which will bring new hope to patients with osteosarcoma, neuroblastoma and gastric cancer"
