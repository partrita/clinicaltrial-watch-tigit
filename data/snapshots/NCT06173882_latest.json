The main questions it aims to answer are:\n\nBased on randomized controlled trials, verify the effectiveness of moxibustion in treating allergic rhinitis Based on a real-time monitoring system for human surface temperature, discuss the differences in therapeutic effects of different moxibustion doses on allergic rhinitis",
      "detailedDescription": "Allergic rhinitis has a high incidence and is difficult to cure, seriously affecting the quality of life of patients Compare the effects of different moxibustion durations on the clinical efficacy and body surface temperature of patients with allergic rhinitis, and preliminarily explore the impact of different moxibustion doses on the efficacy of heavy moxibustion treatment for allergic rhinitis, providing evidence-based basis for clinical practice."
