      "briefSummary": "This phase I, first-in-human, open-label clinical study will evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetic characteristics and preliminary efficacy of HLX53 (an anti-TIGIT Fc fusion protein) in patients with advanced/metastatic solid tumors.",
      "detailedDescription": "This study is an open-label phase I clinical study to evaluate the safety, tolerability , PK/PD and preliminary efficacy of HLX53 in patients with advanced/metastatic solid tumor. 11-30 subjects with advanced or metastatic solid tumors will be enrolled. The accelerated titration and traditional 3 + 3 dose escalation design will be implemented. Subjects will receive intravenous infusion of HLX53 at different doses according to the order of enrollment. There are 5 preset dose groups, namely 30mg/QW, 150mg/QW, 400mg/QW, 1000mg/Q3W and 2000mg/Q3W, administered by intravenous infusion. Observation period of DLT will last for 21 days after the first administration of HLX53. Maximum tolerated dose (MTD) definition: The highest dose level at which no more than 1 of 6 DLT-evaluable subjects developed DLT. At the MTD dose, at least 6 subjects were evaluable for DLT. When the MTD is determined, the MTD is usually used as the RP2D, or the RP2D is determined based on safety, PK/PD/ADA/NAb characteristics, and potential clinical efficacy."
