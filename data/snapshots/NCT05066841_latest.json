      "briefSummary": "The purpose of study is to provide an objective data for evaluating the efficacy and safety of Chinese medicine (CM) formula combined with inhaled corticosteroid in the treatment of asthmatic children. Investigators will recruit eighty-six mild to moderate asthmatic children aged 4-11 years old with regular ICS usage and they will be randomized into two groups in this double-blind trial. Forty-three subjects will receive CM (CM group; Ma-Hsing-Kan-Shih-Tang in combination with Liu-Jun-Zi-Tang) and the other forty-three subjects will receive placebo (placebo group; 10% CM) for 12 weeks. Investigators will compare these two groups by questionnaires of Childhood Asthma Control Test (cACT), the Integrated Therapeutics Group Child Asthma Short Form (ITG-CASF), Pediatric Asthma Caregiver's Quality of Life Questionnaire (PACQLQ), the pulmonary function test and blood test including Complete Blood Count with Differential Count (CBC/DC), total IgE, Eosinophil Cationic Protein (ECP) and IL-4/IL-5/IL-13. Adverse events, renal and liver function test will be evaluated to investigate the safety of CM formula as well.",
      "detailedDescription": "Treating pediatric asthma has been in accordance with GINA guidelines by stepwise approach to adjust treatment for individual patient needs. However, most of the asthma controller medication nowadays is inhaled corticosteroids (ICS). Parents with steroid phobia may raise concern and fears about the potential systemic effects, leading to poor adherence to medication and worse control.\n\nThis study aims to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Chinese medicine (CM) formula combined with inhaled corticosteroid for the treatment of mild to moderate persistent asthma in children. Investigators focus on the following specific aims: Aim 1. To determine the efficacy of the CM formula (Ma-Hsing-Kan-Shih-Tang in combination with Liu-Jun-Zi-Tang) compared with placebo; Aim 2. To evaluate the effects of CM formula on quality of life in these patients with pediatric asthma; Aim 3. To investigate the safety of CM formula in these patients with pediatric asthma.\n\nEighty-six mild to moderate asthmatic children aged 4-11 years old with regular ICS usage will be randomized into two groups in this double-blind trial. Forty-three subjects will receive CM (CM group; Ma-Hsing-Kan-Shih-Tang in combination with Liu-Jun-Zi-Tang) and the other forty-three subjects will receive placebo (placebo group; 10% CM) for 12 weeks. The evaluation including pulmonary function test, IOS, FeNO, blood test, questionnaire and asthma diary card of both two groups will be conducted during the study period. The safety of CM formula use will be investigated by recording the adverse events and renal and liver function test as well.\n\nThis study will provide an objective data for evaluating the efficacy and safety o of Chinese medicine (CM) formula combined with inhaled corticosteroid in the treatment of asthmatic children. Through the combination of Chinese and western medicine, we expect to enhance the efficacy of asthma treatment, reduce acute exacerbation and tapper the dose of inhaled corticosteroids, leading to better quality of life."
