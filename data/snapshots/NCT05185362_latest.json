      "briefSummary": "IgE-mediated food allergy can manifest with reactions ranging from hives to anaphylactic shock. The diagnosis is based on the confirmation of sensitization to the food allergen by skin tests (prick) and the determination of specific IgE directed against the food source and molecular allergens. The gold standard remains the oral provocation test, which is performed in a hospital environment. Once the diagnosis is made, an elimination diet is still considered as the cornerstone of treatment for most food allergies.\n\nWhile some allergies, such as cow's milk or egg, tend to resolve spontaneously, others, such as allergy to pecan nuts, show a tendency to be persistent. In addition, pecan allergy is often characterized by potentially serious clinical reactions, compared to other foods, which can even be life threatening. In our clinical practice, the investigators found that patients with allergies to pecan nuts often present with severe hypersensitivity reactions when challenged orally to this food. Beyond this information, there are few studies regarding pecans. The investigators decided to retrospectively evaluate the results of oral food challenge and of the allergy work-up in our patients sensitized and allergic to pecan nuts, to better understand the current epidemiology of such food allergy."
