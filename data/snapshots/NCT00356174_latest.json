      "briefSummary": "The purpose of this study is to observe the natural course of food allergy, including both the development of peanut allergy in infants at high risk for developing this allergy, and the resolution of both egg and cow's milk allergy.",
      "detailedDescription": "This observational study will investigate the developmental immunology of peanut, egg, and milk allergy in a cohort of milk- or egg-allergic children who are at risk for peanut allergy. This strategy will help to delineate, compare, and contrast biological markers and immunologic changes associated with the development of peanut allergy and loss of egg and milk allergy, while simultaneously evaluating important clinical and environmental influences likely to account for the recent rise in the prevalence of these allergies. The hallmark of food-allergic disease is the production of food-specific Immunoglobulin E (IgE) antibodies that represent an end result of a T helper 2 (Th2) influenced immune response. Currently, there is only a limited understanding of the mechanisms involved in the developmental course of food allergies. To effectively prevent or reverse the progression of food allergy, immune interventions will be needed. Furthermore, it is likely that successful strategies will need to be directed to those persons at identifiable risk (e.g., who have biomarkers associated with development of peanut allergy)."
