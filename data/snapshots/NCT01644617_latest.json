The primary hypothesis is that administration of MK-8237, compared to placebo, results in dose-related improvement in the average total nasal symptom score (TNSS) determined during environmental exposure chamber (EEC) challenge."

The endpoint was based on participant diary entries over the last 4 hours of the EEC challenge session at Week 24. TNSS was the total of scores for the 4 nasal symptoms, each scored on a 4-point rating scale (0=no symptoms; 1=mild symptoms; 2=moderate symptoms; 3=severe symptoms). The total TNSS ranged from 0 to 12 points. The 24-week TNSS was analyzed using the analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model with treatment and baseline TNSS as covariates and expressed as a least squares mean with 95% confidence interval. A decrease in TNSS for participants receiving either dose of MK-8237 compared to placebo indicated an improvement in symptoms.",
