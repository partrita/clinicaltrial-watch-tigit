      "briefSummary": "Substudy 02B is part of a larger research study where researchers are looking for new ways to treat advanced melanoma that has not been treated before. The larger study is the umbrella study. Researchers want to know if adding other treatments to pembrolizumab can treat advanced melanoma. The goals of this study are to learn:\n\n* About the safety and how well people tolerate pembrolizumab given with other treatments\n* How many people have melanoma that responds (gets smaller or goes away) to treatment",
      "detailedDescription": "With Amendment 6, all arms are closed to enrollment. Participants in arms 2 (pembrolizumab), 3 (coformulation pembrolizumab/quavonlimab), and 4 (coformulation pembrolizumab/quavonlimab + lenvatinib) who complete study treatment or otherwise meet end of treatment (EOT) criteria will be discontinued from the study after completing the EOT visit and any required safety follow-up visits. Participants in arm 6 (coformulation favezelimab/pembrolizumab + All-trans Retinoic Acid \\[ATRA\\]) will discontinue ATRA and participants in arms 5 and 6 can continue on coformulation favezelimab/pembrolizumab or pembrolizumab."
