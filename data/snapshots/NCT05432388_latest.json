      "briefSummary": "A study to evaluate the safety, efficacy and tolerability of remibrutinib at three doses versus placebo in adult participants who have a confirmed allergy to peanuts. The efficacy will be measured by the ability of participants to tolerate increasing doses of peanut protein during an oral food challenge after 1 month of study treatment.",
      "detailedDescription": "This is a one month, phase 2, multi-center, randomized, investigator- and participant-blinded, placebo controlled study to assess the safety, efficacy and tolerability of remibrutinib (LOU064) in 3 doses of oral tablet twice a day in participants with a medically confirmed diagnosis of IgE-mediated peanut allergy. Participants will be randomized to remibrutinib low, medium or high dose for one-month treatment period (up to 5 weeks). Participants will have oral food challenges at the beginning of the study and at the end of the treatment period to assess their symptoms from increasing doses of peanut allergen."
