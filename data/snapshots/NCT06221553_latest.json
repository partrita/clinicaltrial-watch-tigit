      "briefSummary": "A Phase 1 clinical trial to evaluate the safety and early efficacy of CAR T-cell with IL-7Ra signal targeting B7H3 in children with diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (DIPG) patients after complete standard treatments.",
      "detailedDescription": "The brain tumor known as Diffuse Intrinsic Pontine Glioma is commonly found in children aged between 5 to 10 years. This type of tumor is aggressive and infiltrates the structures of the brain stem. Treatment options are limited due to the location of the tumor, making it impossible to surgically remove the mass like other brain cancers. The standard treatment for this type of tumor is radiation therapy, as this type of cancer does not respond to chemotherapy or currently available targeted drugs. However, radiation therapy has been found to be ineffective and does not improve survival rates.\n\nCurrently, there is development in cancer treatment using immunotherapy, where the patient's immune cells are genetically modified to target the cancer, also known as CAR T cells, for the treatment of recurrent or refractory cancers in solid tumors and brain cancers. The research project aims to study the efficacy and safety of treating patients with pontine glioma using T cells that are antigen-specific and have signals from the interleukin-7 receptor alpha and are specific to the B7H3 antigen on the tumor surface. This research is the first of its kind in Thai patients. The research project expects that this treatment will be highly safe and effective in controlling diffuse pontine glioma."
