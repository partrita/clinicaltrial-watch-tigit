      "briefSummary": "Asthma is a chronic illness characterized by inflammation of the airways. Severe asthma is defined in the literature as asthma not controlled by medication. In recent years it has become known that severe asthma is a variable disease and has subtypes relating to the age of onset, type of inflammation and allergy, obesity, etc.\n\nOur aim is to characterize the phenotypes of severe asthma population in our clinic and compare the prevalent phenotypes to the phenotypes described before.",
      "detailedDescription": "Study measures will include the following:\n\n* asthma demographic and symptoms questionnaire\n* Validation of proper inhaler technique\n* Height, weight measurements\n* Forced spirometry and reversibility testing\n* DLCO\n* Fractional excretion of NO in exhaled breath\n* Chest and sinus CT\n* Induced sputum analysis\n* Complete blood count, electrolytes, immunoglobulin E, Aspergillus Specific IgE\n* Skin allergy testing"
