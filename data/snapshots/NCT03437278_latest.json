      "briefSummary": "This clinical study was designed to evaluate the pharmacokinetics, safety and efficacy of ligelizumab in children from 12 to \\< 18 years of age, with chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU). The participants were treated with ligelizumab as an add-on therapy to approved doses of H1 antihistamines (H1AH) following the guideline on treatment of CSU.",
      "detailedDescription": "This was a Phase IIb dose-finding, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled, multicenter study in adolescent patients. The study consisted of 3 distinct study periods: Screening, Treatment and Follow-up period.\n\nAfter the screening period (up to 4 weeks), at Day 1 participants were randomized into one of the three treatment arms in 1:2:1 fashion to ligelizumab high dose (120 mg every four weeks (q4w)) versus ligelizumab low dose (24 mg q4w) versus placebo. During the 24 weeks of treatment period, doses were administered on Day 1 then on weeks 4, 8, 12, 16, and 20 weeks after randomization. Participants randomized to placebo received placebo on Day 1, Weeks 4 and 8; thereafter they received 120 mg ligelizumab (high dose) on Weeks 12, 16 and 20 such that by the end of the study, the same number of participants received ligelizumab high dose as low dose. The treatment period was followed by a treatment-free follow-up period of 16 weeks to a maximum of Week 40."

Total score ranges from 0 to 30 with higher scores indicating greater health-related quality of life impairment. A negative change score from baseline indicates improvement. Baseline was defined as the last non-missing value prior to or on the first treatment date.\n\nTo handle the missing data, if a participant had only one item missing score per visit, then it was imputed to 0 and total score was calculated accordingly.
