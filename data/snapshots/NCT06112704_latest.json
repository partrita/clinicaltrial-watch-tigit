The objectives of this study are to investigate the anti-tumor activity, safety, pharmacokinetics and immunogenicity of HS-20093 in Chinese advanced esophageal carcinoma and other solid tumor patients.",
      "detailedDescription": "This is an open-label, multi-center phase 2 study in Chinese adult participants with recurrent, locally advanced or metastatic esophageal carcinoma or other advanced solid tumors, which is designed to investigate the efficacy, safety, pharmacokinetics and immunogenicity of HS-20093. This study will consist of two parts: phase IIa and phase IIb.\n\nPart 1 (phase IIa) will conducted in participants with relapsed, locally advanced or metastatic esophageal carcinoma and other advanced solid tumor. Subjects will receive one dose levels of HS-20093 intravenously every 3 weeks.\n\nPart 2 (phase IIb) will enroll participants with relapsed, locally advanced or metastatic esophageal squamous cell carcinoma. One dose levels of HS-20093 will be administered as an intravenous (IV) infusion every 3 weeks."
