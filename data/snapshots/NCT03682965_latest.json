      "detailedDescription": "TX-SMILE is an investigator-initiated, multi-center, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled study to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of an alternative injection site and associated adjustments to dosing and treatment regimen for allergen immunotherapy with a commercially-available, FDA-approved allergenic extract for the immunotherapy treatment of allergic rhinitis and conjunctivitis due to pollen from the conifer Mountain Cedar (Juniperus ashei).\n\nThe purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of a three-dose treatment series of ultrasonography-guided, intra-lymphatic immunotherapy injections over a two-month period prior to the start of the 2018-2019 Mountain Cedar allergy season in central Texas. Patients will be evaluated for safety and tolerability during the treatment period and for efficacy during the 2018-2019 Texas Mountain Cedar pollen season."

The total safety score for each group is the sum of the individual scores of each patient across all three treatments (exposures).

Following allergen or placebo exposure via intra-lymphatic injection, patients are monitored for local and systemic allergic reactions for up to 60 minutes post-procedure. At each exposure, a score is rated on a scale from none = 0, local reactions only = 1, mild systemic reactions (WAO Grade 1/2) = 2, moderate systemic reaction (WAO Grade 3) = 3, and severe systemic reaction (WAO grade 4) = 4. The total safety score for each group is the sum of the individual scores of each patient across all three treatments (exposures). Thus, the subject may have a score from 0 to 12 with 0 reflecting no allergic reaction to the allergen and 12 reflecting severe allergic reactions, and the TSS for a group is the sum for all patients in the group. The TSS is used to elicit and grade adverse events of interest rather than for statistical analysis.",
