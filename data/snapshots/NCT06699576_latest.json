      "briefSummary": "HS-20093 is a fully humanized IgG1 antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) which specifically binds to B7-H3, a target wildly expressed on bone and soft tissue sarcoma. The objectives of this study are to investigate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and anti-tumor activity of HS-20093 in combination with other anti-cancer agents in patients with advanced bone and soft tissue sarcoma.",
      "detailedDescription": "This is a phase 1b, open-label, multi-center, dose-escalation and expansion study in subjects with advanced bone and soft tissue sarcoma. This study is in design allowing assessment of safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and anti-tumor activity of HS-20093 in combination with other anti-cancer agents.\n\nA total of 4 combination-treatments will be carried out in 2 cohorts. The target population in cohort 1 of dose escalation part is soft tissue sarcoma patients have progressed on or intolerant to available standard therapies, and the dose expansion part will enroll patients who have not received prior treatment for advanced/metastatic disease. The target population in cohort 2 will enroll patients with osteosarcoma have progressed on or intolerant to available standard therapies All patients will be carefully followed for adverse events during the study treatment and for 90 days after the last dose of study drug. Subjects will be permitted to continue therapy with assessments for progression if the product is well tolerated and sustained clinical benefit exists"
