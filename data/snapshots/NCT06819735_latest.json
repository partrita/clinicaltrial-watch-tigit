      "detailedDescription": "This is a phase 1/2, first-in-human, multicenter, open-label clinical study to assess the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and efficacy of DT-7012, administered as monotherapy and in combination with an immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI), in participants with selected recurrent advanced/metastatic solid tumors.\n\nThis study includes:\n\n* a phase 1 Monotherapy Dose Escalation\n* a phase 1b Combination Dose Escalation (this part will be initiated upon recommendation from the Safety Review Committee based on Monotherapy Dose Escalation data and corresponds to a dose escalation of a combination of DT-7012 with an ICI)\n* a subsequent phase 2 Indication-Specific Efficacy part\n\nThe phase 1 aims at determining the maximum tolerated dose or maximum administered dose of DT-7012 as single agent and in combination with an ICI, and the safety and tolerability of DT-7012 as single agent and in combination with an ICI in participants with selected recurrent advanced/metastatic solid tumors.\n\nThe phase 2 will assess the efficacy of DT-7012 as monotherapy and/or in combination with an ICI in indication-specific cohorts."
