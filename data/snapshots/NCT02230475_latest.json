      "briefSummary": "This clinical study will use the Environmental Exposure Unit (EEU) to generate allergic rhinitis symptoms in participants under controlled conditions, to collect well-characterized biological samples (urine and blood) before and after they develop these symptoms. The EEU provides the ability to control the timing, duration and levels of allergen exposure, and also other outside environmental factors, yielding ideal biologic samples for analysis with novel, cutting-edge molecular techniques. Results from the analysis of these unique allergic rhinitis samples should help determine if the technique of urine Nuclear Magnetic Resonance analysis could be a useful diagnostic tool in allergic rhinitis. IgE testing will be done on blood samples and compared to spin prick testing and symptoms of allergic rhinitis."
