      "briefSummary": "Background:\n\nAD-HIES is a disease that weakens the immune system. It puts people at risk for infections, particularly Staph and Candida infections. Researchers want to test a vaccine that may help keep people from getting these infections, which would help people with AD-HIES.\n\nObjective:\n\nTo test the new vaccine NDV-3A for protection against infection from the yeast Candida and the bacterium Staphylococcus aureus (Staph).\n\nEligibility:\n\nAdults ages 18-55 who have AD-HIES\n\nHealthy volunteers ages 18-55\n\nDesign:\n\nParticipants will have 6-7 study visits over 6-7 months. They will also be contacted by phone in between some visits.\n\nParticipants will be screened with a medical history, physical exam, and blood and urine tests.\n\nParticipants will have 2 baseline visits. They will have repeat the screening tests. They will have samples of saliva, stool, skin, mucus (oral, nasal, and/or vaginal) collected. Vaginal and stool samples are optional. Any eczema on their skin will be looked at.\n\nParticipants will fill out symptom diary cards to record how they feel.\n\nParticipants will have the NDV-3A vaccine injected into a muscle in the arm.\n\nParticipants will return the next 2 days. They will have a physical exam. Blood will be collected.\n\nParticipants will have 2 more follow-up visits at the NIH. They will have a physical exam. They will have blood, saliva, stool, skin, vaginal fluid, and/or mucus samples collected. Vaginal and stool samples are optional.\n\nParticipants will be called once a month for 5 months after the vaccination. There is an optional visit about 6 weeks after the vaccination. Participants will provide a blood sample at this visit.",
      "detailedDescription": "Autosomal-dominant hyper-IgE syndrome (AD-HIES) is characterized by recurrent Staphylococcus aureus and Candida epithelial infections, which is thought to be due, in part, to a lack of Th17 cell differentiation, thus impairing epithelial immunity. Treatment of AD-HIES is primarily supportive with prophylactic antibiotics; however, this is limited by microbial resistance and intolerance of medications, and infections do still occur. Immunological intervention with a vaccine could improve quality of life by preventing these infections altogether.\n\nThe NDV-3A vaccine consists of a recombinant protein derived from the Candida Als3 adhesion protein. This protein is homologous to surface proteins on S aureus and has been shown in preclinical studies to protect against both intravascular and subcutaneous challenge with S aureus. Therefore, NDV-3A represents not only the first antifungal vaccine, but also the first vaccine to provide cross-kingdom protection. In Phase 1 and Phase 2 studies in healthy volunteers (150 receiving vaccine), the safety profile of this vaccine is very reassuring as the vaccine elicits a strong antibody response after a single dose in all vaccinees as well as a Th1 and/or Th17 response in the majority of vaccinees. We will enroll 20 healthy adult volunteers and 20 adults with AD-HIES in an open-label, single-dose study to assess the immunological response to and the safety/tolerability of the NDV-3A vaccine. We anticipate an increase in baseline anti-Als3 IgG within 2 weeks post-vaccination."
