      "detailedDescription": "In this non-interventional study, the change in level of allergen-specific IgE before and after 3 or more years of allergen-specific immunotherapy with Pollinex Quattro in a patient population with tree and/or grass pollen induced pollinosis and/or asthma will be analyzed. In addition, the change in medication usage, asthma status for asthmatic patients after 3, 4 or 5 years of allergen specific immunotherapy will be evaluated. Furthermore, patients will be asked for their change in quality of life after therapy end."
