      "briefSummary": "Peanut allergy is a growing public health problem in developed countries with more and more hospitalizations for anaphylaxis. It has been determined that sensitization to certain peanut proteins such as rAra h 2, is predictive of allergy and could predict the severity of reaction (anaphylaxis) during Oral food challenges (OFC). So far, consensual threshold for cutaneous test and IgE as predictor in the positivity of OFC have not been determined. Identification of reactive doses for OFC and phenotype of patients would help to personalize management of patients subgroups, with an optimal security."
