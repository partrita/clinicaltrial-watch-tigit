      "briefSummary": "This is an open label observational single center study of clinical food oral immunotherapy outcomes with biomarker samples and participant and/or caregiver-completed questionnaires in participants between 6 months and 65 years of age with IgE-mediated peanut allergy undergoing food oral immunotherapy.",
      "detailedDescription": "In this research study the investigators want to learn more about the experience of participants with peanut allergy and their caregivers undergoing food oral immunotherapy (OIT) for peanut allergy. Food oral immunotherapy (OIT) is a treatment for individuals with a food allergy to reduce the body's allergic response to the food allergen, resulting in fewer symptoms. The treatment is also called desensitization. An individual becomes desensitized to the food allergen by ingesting small amounts of the food that are slowly increased. Over time, this helps the body's immune system become used to the food so that it no longer causes an allergic reaction. By desensitizing to peanut, it may lower the risk of life-threatening allergic reactions and cause a decreased sensitivity to peanut. The investigators specifically want to learn more about the effects of food OIT on quality of life and other outcomes important to participants with peanut allergy and their caregivers and to ultimately develop tests to predict who may respond favorably to food OIT."
