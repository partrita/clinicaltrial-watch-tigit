The study duration for participants will be approximately 9 weeks. A total of 20 participants will be recruited for the entire study. Each arm will consist of 10 participants.The study will enroll 20 children, male or female, 1 - 8 years of age with atopic dermatitis (AD) associated with food allergens, previously documented by skin or RAST test, before enrollment. Atopic dermatitis and gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms will be scored and followed throughout the study."
