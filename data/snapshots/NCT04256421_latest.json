Eligible participants will be stratified by Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Status (0 vs. 1), LDH (\\</= upper limit of normal \\[ULN\\] vs. \\> ULN), and presence or history of brain metastasis (yes vs. no) and randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive one of the following treatment regimens during induction phase:\n\n* Arm A: Tiragolumab plus atezolizumab plus CE\n* Arm B: Placebo plus atezolizumab plus CE\n\nFollowing the induction phase, participants will continue maintenance therapy with either atezolizumab plus tiragolumab (Arm A) or atezolizumab plus placebo (Arm B)."

There were two components to the EQ-5D-5L: a five-item health state profile that assessed mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression, as well as a visual analog scale (VAS) that measured health state. The EQ VAS records the participant's self-rated health on a vertical visual analogue scale ranging from 0 to 100 A single composite score was calculated based on the responses as an indicator of the participant's health status. The scale ranges 0-100, 0=worst health and 100=best health.",

There were two components to the EQ-5D-5L: a five-item health state profile that assessed mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression, as well as a visual analog scale (VAS) that measured health state. The EQ VAS records the participant's self-rated health on a vertical visual analogue scale ranging from 0 to 100 A single composite score was calculated based on the responses as an indicator of the participant's health status. The scale ranges 0-100, 0=worst health and 100=best health.",
