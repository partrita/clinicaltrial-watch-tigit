QLQ-OES18 is comprised of 18 questions grouped into 4 multi-item subscales: Dysphagia (3 items), Eating (4 items), Reflux (2 items), and Pain (3 items) and 6 single item subscales (saliva swallowing, choking, dry mouth, taste, coughing, and talking). Participants indicate the extent to which they have experienced symptoms on a scale from 1 (Not at all) to 4 (Very much). Scores are calculated and transformed to a scale from 0 to 100; higher scores indicate a higher level of symptomatology or problems.",
