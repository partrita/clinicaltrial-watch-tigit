      "briefSummary": "3CAR is being done to investigate an immunotherapy for patients with solid tumors. It is a Phase I clinical trial evaluating the use of autologous T cells genetically engineered to express B7-H3-CARs for patients ≤ 21 years old, with relapsed/refractory B7-H3+ solid tumors. This study will evaluate the safety and maximum tolerated dose of B7-H3-CAR T cells.The purpose of this study is to find the maximum (highest) dose of B7-H3-CAR T cells that are safe to give to patients with B7-H3-positive solid tumors.\n\nPrimary objective\n\nTo determine the safety of one intravenous infusion of autologous, B7-H3-CAR T cells in patients (≤ 21 years) with recurrent/refractory B7-H3+ solid tumors after lymphodepleting chemotherapy\n\nSecondary objective\n\nTo evaluate the antitumor activity of B7-H3-CAR T cells\n\nExploratory objectives\n\n* To evaluate the tumor environment after treatment with B7-H3-CAR T cells\n* To assess the immunophenotype, clonal structure and endogenous repertoire of B7-H3-CAR T cells and unmodified T cells\n* To characterize the cytokine profile in the peripheral blood after treatment with B7-H3-CAR T cells",
      "detailedDescription": "Treatment will include a single infusion of B7-H3-CAR T cells after lymphodepleting chemotherapy, with dosing based on the number of CAR+ T cells and patient weight. The study will evaluate the safety and maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of B7-H3-CAR T cells, using a standard 3+3 study design and a 6-week evaluation period. The total study duration will be 1 year, at which point patients will enroll on our existing institutional long-term follow-up protocol."
