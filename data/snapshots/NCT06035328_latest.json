So the purpose of our study is to compare short term unresponsiveness rate between once daily dose and four times/week dose during one year maintenance phase of wheat OIT",
      "detailedDescription": "All subject in this study were patients with history of IgE mediated wheat allergy and positive OFC test. All of them received wheat OIT and reached target maintenance dose of wheat OIT.\n\nThe primary outcome was to compare short term unresponsiveness rate between once daily dose and four times/week dose during one year maintenance phase of wheat OIT. Other outcomes were collected during the projected such as blood and skin examination for immunologic parameter, changing in Body weight, WA, WH and BMI, compliance, adverse reactions, rates of medication used during OIT and quality of life"
