      "briefSummary": "The purpose of this study is to characterize the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK), Immunogenicity and preliminary antitumor activity of HC006 in subjects with advanced solid tumor malignancies. This study is a first-in-human (FIH) study of HC006 in subjects with advanced solid tumors.",
      "detailedDescription": "HC006, a novel therapeutic monoclonal antibody that specifically binds to human C-C motif chemokine receptor 8 (CCR8) and is designed to selectively deplete tumor-infiltrating T regulatory cells (Tregs) with enhanced antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC). In mouse tumor models, HC006 has demonstrated excellent antitumor activity and safety profile. This first-in-human (FIH) study will be conducted in two parts. In the Dose-Escalation part, testing will be done on up to 31 subjects to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and the recommended dose (RD). In the Dose-expansion part, we will evaluate the safety and efficacy of the recommended dose of HC006 in the treatment of advanced solid tumor subjects without standard therapy."
