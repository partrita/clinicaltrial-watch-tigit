      "detailedDescription": "The Russian Severe Asthma Registry is a Russian initiative to collect anonymous long-term evidence for patients with severe asthma in Russia. The RSAR initiative is realized under the efforts of the Interregional Public Organization \"Russian Respiratory Society\" and LLC \"RSMI\" with the sponsorship of \"AstraZeneca Pharmaceuticals\" LLC.\n\nThe developed RSAR electronic database is a Russian software product that meets the current requirements of the Russian legislation in the field of working with personal data and the implementation of similar observational studies.\n\nParticipating researchers also agree to grant access and share anonymous data at the patient level as part of the work to implement the RSAR initiative. Participants will provide high-quality data for the development of data sets for research, approved by the Russian Respiratory Society (RPO), which has priority in owning and implementation in scientific field of the gained data. Based on ethical, legal and regulatory authorizations, anonymous data will be collected in the Central Database (CDB) on respiratory diseases (referred to here as the RSAR database) to create sets of important data and the necessary analysis. CDB is part of the software \"Medical online platform ROSMED.INFO\"."
