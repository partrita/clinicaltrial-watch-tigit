The total score is the sum of the scores for all 22 items, ranging from 0 to 110, with a lower score indicating less disease and better HRQoL.

For each study day, a score was calculated using an average of the prior 7 days among available days within a pre-specified window (For Week 24: Study Days 155 to 186), excluding the study day itself, if a value had been recorded by the participant on at least 4 of the prior 7 days, otherwise the 7-day prior average for that study day was to be considered missing.

The free IgE assay had limited range to measure circulating levels of free IgE in the presence of complexes of omalizumab-IgE. According to the analysis plan for the free IgE assay, results above ULQ were set to 62.5 IU/mL. If results for one-third or fewer of the participants were greater than the ULQ, then all summary statistics were to be reported. However, if the results for more than one-third of participants were greater than the ULQ, then only the median, interquartile range and minimum were calculated, and the mean, standard deviation, and maximum were non-reportable.",

          "description": "Serum concentrations of total immunoglobulin E (IgE) and free IgE were measured throughout the 24-week blinded treatment period, as target engagement biomarkers of omalizumab, using validated quantitative immunoassays with lower limits of quantification of 2 and 0.83 International Units per millilitre (IU/mL), respectively, and upper limits of quantification (ULQ) of 5000 and 62.5 IU/mL, respectively. The free IgE assay had limited range to measure circulating levels of free IgE in the presence of complexes of omalizumab-IgE. According to the analysis plan for the free IgE assay, results above ULQ were set to 62.5 IU/mL. If results for one-third or fewer of the participants were greater than the ULQ, then all summary statistics were to be reported. However, if the results for more than one-third of participants were greater than the ULQ, then only the median, interquartile range and minimum were calculated, and the mean, standard deviation, and maximum were non-reportable.",
