Clinical diagnosis of peanut allergy made by an experienced allergy specialist.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\nFor peanut OIT patients:\n\n1. Anaphylaxis to a food other than peanut - despite attempted avoidance - within the last 2 years.\n2. History of life-threatening anaphylaxis or angioedema, including previous intensive care unit (ITU) admission attributable peanut allergy.\n3. Asthmatic treated with higher than moderate dose of ICS (\\>800 mcg equivalent of beclomethasone dipropionate (BDP) per day).\n4. Any asthmatic if uncontrolled or difficult to control as evidenced by any following: ACQ\\>1; FEV1 \\<80% predicted; FEV1/ forced vital capacity (FVC) \\<0.7 irrespective of treatment; hospital attendance (A\\&E or admission) for asthma in the past 2 years; treatment of asthma with oral steroids within last 2 years.\n5.

Participants who react to less than 1 mg of peanut protein on DBPCFC, or who cannot tolerate at least an initial dose of 1.5 mg peanut protein on OIT initiation day.\n7. Participants who react to placebo during DBPCFC.\n8. Ongoing treatment with beta-blockers, biologics (such as omalizumab or mepolizumab) or systemic immunosuppressive treatment.\n9. Regular ongoing use of NSAIDs for a chronic condition (NSAIDs may act as a co-factor for allergic reactions)\n10. For females a positive serum or urine pregnancy test with sensitivity of less than 50 mIU/mL within 72 hours of first administration of study therapy.\n11. Lactating females.\n12. The use of any investigational drug within 30 days of the screening visit.\n13. Past history of eosinophilic oesophagitis or chronic gastro-oesophageal reflux symptoms requiring regular treatment with anti-acids.\n14. Inability to discontinue antihistamines for a minimum of 4 days prior to DBPCFC visits\n15. The presence of any medical condition that the investigator deems incompatible with participation in the trial.\n16. Individuals with insufficient understanding of the trial.\n\nFor mechanistic sub-study subjects:\n\n1. Ongoing treatment with biologic or systemic immunosuppressive treatment.\n2. Known current pregnancy\n3. Lactating females.\n4. The use of any investigational drug within 30 days of the screening visit.\n5. Inability to discontinue antihistamines for a minimum of 4 days prior to venesection.\n6.
