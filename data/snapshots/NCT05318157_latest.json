      "briefSummary": "Allergic rhinitis (AR) is a noninfectious inflammatory disease of the nasal mucosa mediated by immunoglobulin E (IgE) after exposure to allergens. Artemisia annua is one of the most important allergen that is responsible for seasonal AR in China during July and October. Allergen specific immunotherapy (AIT) is the only etiological treatment available for AR.\n\nThe trial is a randomized, Open label, multicentred trial. A total of 150 subjects with allergic rhinitis caused by Artemisia pollen were recruited and randomized to the immunotherapy group and conversation drugs group."
