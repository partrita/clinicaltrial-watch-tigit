      "briefSummary": "In this study, investigators evaluated for the first time the diagnostic efficacy of abioSCOPE® versus Phadia Laboratory System as an aid in the diagnosis of allergic diseases. Investigators targetted the agreement between test results obtained in abioSCOPE® and a laboratory reference method (Phadia Laboratory System, ThermoFisher Scientific, Uppsala, Sweden), considered as a quasi-gold standard in IgE (immunoglobulin E) antibody assays. Investigators also reported the medical decision taken by a panel of allergy experts who had access to patient history, skin tests and IgE antibody assay, but blinded to the method used, i,e, the reference method or the abioSCOPE® ."

This means a dose of Prednisone or equivalent substance greater than or equal to 0.5 mg per kg / day. Inhaled topical steroids are allowed.\n* Administration of any immunoglobulin, any immunotherapy or administration of some blood products in the 3 months preceding the study, or planned during the study period.\n* Any health condition or patient history, in the opinion of the investigator, could interfere with the evaluation of the study's objectives.\n* Participation in another experimental protocol during the period of the study.\n* Demonstration, confirmation or suspicion of a condition of immunosuppression or immunodeficiency (including HIV infection) based on medical history and physical examination (no laboratory test).\n* A family history of congenital or hereditary immunodeficiency.\n* Subjects taking any of the following medications: antihistamines in the week preceding the consultation, systemic steroids (inhaled or nasal steroids are allowed), anti-cytokines or cytokines, systemic interferon (injection local interferon α for the treatment of HPV is allowed) or treated with systemic chemotherapy.",
