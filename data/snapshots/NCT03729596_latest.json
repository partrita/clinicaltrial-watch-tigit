Patients with solid tumors will be enrolled in the Dose Escalation Phase; Cohort Expansion will include metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC), non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN), and melanoma. Patients who do not experience unacceptable toxicity or meet criteria for permanent discontinuation may undergo additional cycles for up to two years. Patients in Cohort Expansion will be followed for survival every 3 months for 2 years following last dose."
