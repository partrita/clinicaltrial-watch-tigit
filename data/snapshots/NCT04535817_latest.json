      "briefSummary": "Following the publication of two case studies that reported behavioral benefit in ASD patients treated with omalizumab, the investigators will conduct a pilot trial to test the proof-of-concept efficacy of omalizumab in ASD patients with comorbid atopic disease. Investigators will evaluate behavioral improvement using three questionnaires. Investigators will also perform fMRI on all subjects and obtain serum samples for quantification of immunological biomarkers. If the trial is conclusive, the investigators will conduct a larger-scale, randomized-controlled trial to further understand the pathology of allergy in this subpopulation of ASD patients and the efficacy of this intervention.",
      "detailedDescription": "This clinical trial is a Phase I, single-arm, open-label study. All 20 subjects will be given the same dosage of the study drug. Following baseline testing, subjects will undergo treatment during a 24 week treatment period and will receive six subcutaneous injections total, one injection every 4 weeks. A 24-week follow-up period after the treatment period will be concluded with patient interview. Behavioral questionnaires will be administered throughout the duration of the trial. fMRI will be conducted at baseline and at the conclusion of the treatment period. Blood will be drawn for serum testing at baseline, at Week 12 during the treatment period, and at the conclusion of the treatment period. Vitals and CGI will also be assessed throughout the trial."
