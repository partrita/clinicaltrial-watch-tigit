      "briefSummary": "In this study, the investigators want to find out whether a specific medication commonly used for severe allergic reactions is really necessary. When children have allergic reactions to foods, they are often given medications to relieve the symptoms. In addition to adrenaline and antihistamines, steroids are frequently administered in German-speaking Switzerland. However, it is unclear whether steroids are really helpful in this situation. To investigate this, the investigators are comparing two groups: one group receives additional steroids, and the other does not. Which treatment a participant receives is decided randomly, like flipping a coin. The study takes place during a pre-scheduled provocation test at the clinic. If an allergic reaction occurs, the usual emergency medications will be administered. Doctors will closely monitor how the reaction develops. No additional tests or visits are required. The results of this study could help improve allergy treatment in the future."
