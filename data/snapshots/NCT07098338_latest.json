The study will consist of several sub-studies, each evaluating the safety, tolerability, and preliminary antitumour activity of various treatment combinations. This study will be conducted in approximately 80 centers globally across 10 countries.",
      "detailedDescription": "The master protocol will include 3 sub-studies, each focused on a specific disease population.\n\n* Sub-study 1 will investigate rilvegostomig± ramucirumab in 1L non-actionable genomic alterations (AGA) NSCLC with PD-L1 ≥50%.\n* Sub-study 2 will investigate rilvegostomig + ramucirumab in 1L non-actionable genomic alterations (AGA) NSCLC with PD-L1 1-49%.\n* Sub-study 3 will investigate Dato-DXd + ramucirumab ± rilvegostomig in 2/3L AGA+\n\nEach sub-study may include 2 parts (unless stated in the individual sub study protocols): Part A: one or more Safety Run-in cohort(s), and Part B: one or more Dose Expansion cohort(s)."
