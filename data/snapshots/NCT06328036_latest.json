      "briefSummary": "This phase II trial compares the safety, side effects and effectiveness of atezolizumab with tiragolumab to atezolizumab alone in treating patients with glioblastoma that has come back after a period of improvement (recurrent). Glioblastoma is the most common primary brain cancer in adults and despite aggressive treatment, it is nearly always fatal. Currently, there are limited effective treatment options in patients that have recurrence. Immunotherapy has been shown to be effective in other types of cancer and may be an appealing potential treatment option for recurrent glioblastoma. Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as atezolizumab and tiragolumab, may help the body's immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Study doctors also want to learn if a tumor infiltrating T lymphocyte (TIL) response is helpful to determine the benefit of the combination of study drugs compared to the usual approach. TILs are a type of immune cell that has moved from the blood into a tumor. TILs can recognize and kill tumor cells. Giving atezolizumab with tiragolumab may be safe, tolerable and/or effective compared to atezolizumab alone in treating patients with recurrent glioblastoma.",
      "detailedDescription": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:\n\nI. To evaluate the impact of combination atezolizumab plus tiragolumab on progression free survival.\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To evaluate the impact of atezolizumab, tiragolumab, or their combination on tumor infiltrating T lymphocyte (TIL) density in glioblastoma patients.\n\nII. To evaluate the safety of study drug therapy in patients with glioblastoma in the (neo)adjuvant setting.\n\nIII. To estimate therapeutic benefit of atezolizumab and tiragolumab in the recurrent glioblastoma patient population.\n\nIV. To evaluate the impact of baseline tumor mutation burden and expression on response.\n\nEXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To evaluate the impact of combination treatment on the tumor immune microenvironment.\n\nII. To evaluate the impact of combination treatment on the peripheral immune microenvironment.\n\nIII. To evaluate the peripheral and central pharmacokinetics of tiragolumab and atezolizumab.\n\nOUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 4 groups.\n\nGROUP A: Patients receive atezolizumab intravenously (IV) over 60 minutes and tiragolumab IV over 20-75 minutes and 14-19 days later, undergo surgical resection. Following surgery, patients may receive tiragolumab IV and atezolizumab IV on day 1 of each cycle. Cycles repeat every 21 days for up to 2 years in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Additionally, patients undergo magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at baseline, 24-72 hours after surgery, then every 9 weeks until progression and blood sample collection throughout the study.\n\nGROUP B: Patients receive tiragolumab IV over 20-75 minutes and 14-19 days later, undergo surgical resection. Following surgery, patients may receive tiragolumab IV and atezolizumab IV on day 1 of each cycle. Cycles repeat every 21 days for up to 2 years in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Additionally, patients undergo MRI at baseline, 24-72 hours after surgery, then every 9 weeks until progression and blood sample collection throughout the study.\n\nGROUP C: Patients receive atezolizumab IV over 60 minutes and 14-19 days later, undergo surgical resection. Following surgery patients may receive atezolizumab IV on day 1 of each cycle. Cycles repeat every 21 days for up to 2 years in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Additionally, patients undergo MRI at baseline, 24-72 hours after surgery, then every 9 weeks until progression and blood sample collection throughout the study.\n\nGROUP D: Patients undergo surgical resection on study. Following surgery patients may receive atezolizumab IV on day 1 of each cycle. Cycles repeat every 21 days for up to 2 years in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Additionally, patients undergo MRI at baseline, 24-72 hours after surgery, then every 9 weeks until progression and blood sample collection throughout the study.\n\nAfter completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days, and then every 3 months."

The HCV RNA test will be performed only for patients who have a positive HCV antibody test\n* Patients with a prior or concurrent malignancy whose natural history or treatment does not have the potential to interfere with the safety or efficacy assessment of the investigational regimen are eligible for this trial\n* Patients must be undergoing surgery that is clinically indicated as determined by their care providers\n* Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Patients with IDH mutations will be excluded from the study\n* Patients who have had previous treatment with anti PD1, PDL1, CTLA-4 or other immune checkpoint inhibitors\n* Patients who have undergone tumor directed therapy for the most recent disease progression\n* Patients who have not recovered to grade 0 or 1 or pre-treatment baseline from clinically significant adverse events due to prior anti-cancer therapy (i.e., have residual toxicities \\> grade 1) with the exception of alopecia\n* Patients who are receiving any other investigational agents\n* Patients with a diagnosis of immunodeficiency or who require treatment with high dose systemic corticosteroids defined as dexamethasone \\> 2 mg/day or bioequivalent for at least 3 consecutive days within 1 week of start of study drug\n* Patients with severe, uncontrolled intercurrent illness, comorbidity, or any other significant condition(s) that would make participation in this protocol unreasonably hazardous\n* Patients who are pregnant or breastfeeding or are expecting to conceive or father children within the projected duration of the study, starting with the screening visit through 5 months after the last dose of study treatment. Women of childbearing potential (WOCPB) must have a negative serum pregnancy test result within 14 days prior to initiation of study treatment. A WOCBP who has a positive urine pregnancy test (e.g., within 72 hours) prior to treatment will be excluded from the study. If the urine test is positive or cannot be confirmed as negative, a serum pregnancy test will be required. A woman is considered to be of childbearing potential if she is postmenarchal, has not reached a postmenopausal state (≥ 12 continuous months of amenorrhea with no identified cause other than menopause), and has not undergone surgical sterilization (i.e., removal of ovaries, fallopian tubes, and/or uterus) or another cause as determined by the investigator (e.g., Müllerian agenesis). Per this definition, a woman with a tubal ligation is considered to be of childbearing potential. The definition of childbearing potential may be adapted for alignment with local guidelines or regulations. Pregnant women are excluded from this study because atezolizumab and tiragolumab are monoclonal antibodies with the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with atezolizumab and/or tiragolumab, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated with atezolizumab and/or tiragolumab. To avoid pregnancy, WOCBPs and men must agree to use adequate contraception (i.e., contraceptive methods with a failure rate of \\< 1% per year such as bilateral tubal ligation, male sterilization, hormonal contraceptives that inhibit ovulation, hormone-releasing intrauterine devices, and copper intrauterine devices) prior to the study, during treatment, and for 5 months after treatment ends. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while she or her partner is participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician immediately\n* Patients unable to comply with the protocol and/or not willing or who will not be available for follow-up assessments, specifically MRI scans\n* Active or history of autoimmune disease or immune deficiency, including, but not limited to, myasthenia gravis, myositis, autoimmune hepatitis, systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease, antiphospholipid antibody syndrome, Wegener granulomatosis, Sjogren syndrome, Guillain-Barre syndrome, or multiple sclerosis, with the exceptions listed below:\n\n  * Patients with a history of autoimmune-related hypothyroidism who are on thyroid replacement hormone are eligible for the study\n  * Patients with controlled type 1 diabetes mellitus who are on an insulin regimen are eligible for the study\n  * Patients with eczema, psoriasis, lichen simplex chronicus, or vitiligo with dermatologic manifestations only (e.g., patients with psoriatic arthritis are excluded) are eligible for the study provided all of following conditions are met:\n\n    * Rash must cover \\< 10% of body surface area\n    * Disease is well controlled at baseline and requires only low-potency topical corticosteroids\n    * There has been no occurrence of acute exacerbations of the underlying condition requiring psoralen plus ultraviolet A radiation, methotrexate, retinoids, biologic agents, oral calcineurin inhibitors, or high potency or oral corticosteroids within the previous 12 months\n* Treatment with systemic immunosuppressive medication (including, but not limited to, corticosteroids, cyclophosphamide, azathioprine, methotrexate, thalidomide, and anti-tumor necrosis factor-alpha \\[TNF-alpha\\] agents) within 2 weeks prior to initiation of study treatment, or anticipation of need for systemic immunosuppressive medication during study treatment, with the following exceptions:\n\n  * Patients who received acute, low-dose systemic immunosuppressant medication or a one-time pulse dose of systemic immunosuppressant medication (e.g., 48 hours of corticosteroids for a contrast allergy) are eligible for the study.\n  * Patients who received mineralocorticoids (e.g., fludrocortisone), corticosteroids for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or asthma, or low-dose corticosteroids for orthostatic hypotension or adrenal insufficiency are eligible for the study\n* Patients with presence of extracranial metastatic or leptomeningeal disease\n* Patients that have received anti-angiogenic or anti-VEGF targeted agents (e.g., bevacizumab, cediranib, aflibercept, vandetanib, XL-184, sunitinib, etc.)\n* Patients with patent active tuberculosis (TB)\n* Patients with prior allogeneic bone marrow transplantation or prior solid organ transplantation\n* Patients being treated with systemic immunostimulatory agents (including, but not limited to, interferon \\[IFN\\]-alpha or interleukin \\[IL\\]-2) within 4 weeks prior to cycle 1, day 1.
