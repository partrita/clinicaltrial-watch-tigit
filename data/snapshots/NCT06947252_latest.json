      "briefSummary": "Atopic dermatitis can be caused by several factors, including food allergy. Currently, the diagnosis of food allergy often performing skin tests and measuring specific IgE foods that many studies have shown that about 53% of children with atopic dermatitis have food sensitization, result in avoidance of food intake. But only 15% are confirmed to have a true food allergy, so the purpose of our study is to find the prevalence of food allergy in Thai children with atopic dermatitis who are avoiding some foods, using the oral food challenge to confirm the diagnosis to reduce unnecessary food avoidance and prevent complications from inappropriate dietary restrictions",
      "detailedDescription": "All subject in this study were patients with history of atopic dermatitis and avoid at least 1 food of egg yolk, egg white, cow milk, peanut, wheat or soy. All of them will undergo a blood testing for specific IgE foods to assess whether they can resume consuming that particular food or they must perform oral food challenge test in hospital to evaluate whether they truly have a food allergy or should continue to avoid that food.\n\nThe primary outcome was to study frequency of food allergy confirm by oral food challenge among foods avoidance in atopic dermatitis children, focusing on the 6 major food allergens in the Thai children: egg yolk, egg white, cow milk, peanut, wheat and soy. Other outcomes were study type of food reaction after oral food challenge test in atopic dermatitis children (IgE mediated, delayed type: AD flare)"
