Participants will be assigned to receive etigilimab (every 2 weeks) in combination with nivolumab (240 mg every 2 weeks) and will continue until either unacceptable toxicity or disease progression. Participants may continue to receive treatment beyond documented Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours Version 1.1 (RECIST v1.1) or disease progression. Participants who are both checkpoint inhibitor (CPI) naive as well as participants who have received or progressed following a CPI will be eligible and include the following tumor types: head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), cervical carcinoma, gastric or gastroesophageal carcinoma, endometrial carcinoma, tumor mutation burden high (TMB-H), select rare tumors and ovarian carcinoma."
