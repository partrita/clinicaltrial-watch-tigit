      "briefSummary": "This is a phase 2a, multi-center, randomized and double-blind placebo-controlled trial comparing 24 weeks of abatacept versus placebo used as adjuvant to oral immunotherapy to induce remission in adolescents and adults with persistent severe peanut allergy.\n\nThis is a proof-of-concept trial in which the primary outcome will be the suppression of the initial peanut specific IgE surge during OIT, which is used as a proxy outcome of peanut allergy remission.\n\nAdolescents and adults with persistent severe peanut allergy (n=14) will be randomized to either abatacept or placebo at a ratio 1:1 for a total period of 24 weeks. Peanut oral immunotherapy will be initiated the day following the first administration of the investigational product. Sustained tolerance to peanut will be assessed at 36 weeks."
