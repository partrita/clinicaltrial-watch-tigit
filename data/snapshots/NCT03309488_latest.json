      "briefSummary": "The BAT II Study is a cross-sectional diagnostic study in which children with suspected IgE-mediated allergy to foods (namely cow's milk, egg, sesame and cashew), as defined by a history of an immediate-type allergic reaction to a food or no history of food consumption or the presence of food-specific IgE as documented by skin prick test or serum specific IgE, will undergo a diagnostic work-up to confirm or refute the diagnosis of IgE-mediated food allergy. Participants will be prospectively recruited from specialised Paediatric Allergy clinics in London and will undergo skin prick testing (SPT), specific IgE testing to allergen extracts and allergen components, basophil activation test (BAT) and oral food challenge. The diagnostic accuracy of the BAT and of other allergy tests will be assessed against the clinical gold-standard."
