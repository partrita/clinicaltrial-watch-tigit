Exploratory outcomes include to determine whether Omalizumab use: reduces exacerbations in COPD patients; or improves rescue medication use, decreases ICS use, modified Medical Research Council (MMRC) dyspnea score, St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ), 6-minute walk distance (6MWD), forced expiratory volume at one second (FEV1)(the latter 3 with BMI make up the BODE score), residual volume (RV), total lung capacity (TLC), exhaled nitric oxide (ENO), and determination C-reactive protein (CRP)."
