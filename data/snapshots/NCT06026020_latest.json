      "briefSummary": "There is a direct interaction between food, intestinal flora and the intestinal barrier composed of intestinal epithelial cells and mucosal immunity, whose composition and functional alterations are theorized to be closely related to the development of gastrointestinal (GI) involvement in Behcet's syndrome (BS) patients. Therefore, this study focuses on the population of patients with intestinal BS and explores the unique mechanisms leading to intestinal involvement in BS patients in terms of the characteristics of intestinal microecology. Since oral ulcers are one of the most common clinical manifestations in BS patients, in addition to intestinal flora analysis, this application project also plans to collect saliva samples from patients in the hope of obtaining a holistic understanding of mucosal flora in different parts of the entire GI tract. Serological testing and analysis will also be performed, focusing on changes in the intestinal tract and serum IgE levels, and analyzed in conjunction with microbiomics to provide evidence to further elucidate the pathogenesis of BS and GI involvement, and to search for more efficient therapeutic strategies, in terms of a variety of aspects, including clinical manifestations and disease progression."
