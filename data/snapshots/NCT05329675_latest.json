      "briefSummary": "Trial of Sinphar Lipucan Capsule to regulate immune function",
      "detailedDescription": "The immune system is the line of defense for the health of human life entities. If the function decrease, it will reduce the body's defense to outside pathogen and easily lead to the occurrence of diseases. Immune response includes two kinds of reactions: (1) The innate immune system refers to inherited, germ-line defense mechanisms that are directed against molecular components found only in micro-organisms.. (2) The humoral immune response denotes immunologic responses that are mediated by antibodies. Health hazards have always been a trend based on health awareness. Therefore, how to use a healthy diet to promote the immune system is currently the most concerned research direction.\n\nBecause of the immunomodulatory effect of \" Sinphar Lipucan Capsule \" in previous animal experiments (1) Promote the secretion of Th1 type cytokine by T cells and inhibit the secretion of Th2 type cytokine; 2) Promote the secretion of IFN-γ by macrophages. 3) Promote the production of OVA antigen-specific antibodies in BALB/c female mice; 4) It can inhibit the secretion of IL-10 cytokine by antigen-specific (OVA) immune cells (that is, inhibit the secretion of Th2 cytokine), we think \" Sinphar Lipucan Capsule \" may be beneficial in reducing the severity and incidence of Acute Upper Respiratory Tract Infection. Therefore, human clinical trials were started to confirm its clinical effects and immunomodulatory effects."
