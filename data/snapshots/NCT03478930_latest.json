      "briefSummary": "The overall purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety, efficacy, and durability of response of omalizumab in an open-label setting in adult participants with chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps who completed the double-blind, placebo-controlled, Phase III studies GA39688 (NCT03280550) or GA39855 (NCT03280537). Participants will be eligible for enrollment in the study at, or within 28 days after, the Week 24 visit of Studies GA39688/GA39855. After enrollment into this open-label extension (OLE) study, participants will receive 28 weeks of dosing of omalizumab before entering a 24-week off-treatment observation phase of the study. Baseline in this OLE study is defined as the last pre-treatment measurement prior to randomization in Studies GA39688/GA39855 (i.e., baseline of Studies GA39688/GA39855). The data that will be reported from baseline to Week 24 inclusive will come from Studies GA39688/GA39855."

Two blinded primary independent expert readers reviewed every post-screening recorded video endoscopy for a given participant to determine total NPS. A third reader chose one of the two scores to be used for analysis in cases where there was any discrepancy in total NPS assigned between the two primary readers.",

The four available response options were scored from 0 (no symptoms) to 3 (severe symptoms): 0 = Not at all; 1 = Mild; 2 = Moderate; and 3 = Severe. For each study day, a score was calculated using an average of the prior 7 days among the available days within the pre-specified window (For Week 24: Study Days 155 to 186), excluding the study day itself, if a value had been recorded by the participant on at least 4 of the prior 7 days; otherwise, the 7-day prior average for that study day was to be considered missing. One calculated (non-missing) 7-day prior average was selected for analysis according to the study day with nearest proximity to Week 24 (Study Day 168), with the earlier selected in the case of a tie. Baseline was defined as the (non-missing) 7-day interval ending on the latest day prior to randomization.",

For each study day, a score was calculated using an average of the prior 7 days among the available days within the pre-specified window (For Week 24: Study Days 155 to 186), excluding the study day itself, if a value had been recorded by the participant on at least 4 of the prior 7 days; otherwise, the 7-day prior average for that study day was to be considered missing. One calculated (non-missing) 7-day prior average was selected for analysis according to the study day with nearest proximity to Week 24 (Study Day 168), with the earlier selected in the case of a tie.

The four available response options were scored from 0 (no symptoms) to 3 (severe symptoms): 0 = Not at all; 1 = Mild; 2 = Moderate; and 3 = Severe. For each study day, a score was calculated using an average of the prior 7 days among the available days within the pre-specified window (For Week 24: Study Days 155 to 186), excluding the study day itself, if a value had been recorded by the participant on at least 4 of the prior 7 days; otherwise, the 7-day prior average for that study day was to be considered missing. One calculated (non-missing) 7-day prior average was selected for analysis according to the study day with nearest proximity to Week 24 (Study Day 168), with the earlier selected in the case of a tie. Baseline was defined as the (non-missing) 7-day interval ending on the latest day prior to randomization.",

The four available response options were scored from 0 (no symptoms) to 3 (severe symptoms): 0=Not at all; 1=Mild; 2=Moderate; and 3=Severe. For each study day, a score was calculated using an average of the prior 7 days among available days within a pre-specified window (For Week 24: Study Days 155 to 186), excluding the study day itself, if a value had been recorded by the participant on at least 4 of the prior 7 days, otherwise the 7-day prior average for that study day was to be considered missing. One calculated (non-missing) 7-day prior average was selected for analysis according to the study day with nearest proximity to Week 24 (Study Day 168), with the earlier selected in the case of a tie. Baseline was defined as the (non-missing) 7-day interval ending on the latest day prior to randomization.",

The four available response options were scored from 0 (no symptoms) to 3 (severe symptoms): 0=Not at all; 1=Mild; 2=Moderate; and 3=Severe. For each study day, a score was calculated using an average of the prior 7 days among available days within a pre-specified window (For Week 24: Study Days 155 to 186), excluding the study day itself, if a value had been recorded by the participant on at least 4 of the prior 7 days, otherwise the 7-day prior average for that study day was to be considered missing. One calculated (non-missing) 7-day prior average was selected for analysis according to the study day with nearest proximity to Week 24 (Study Day 168), with the earlier selected in the case of a tie. Baseline was defined as the (non-missing) 7-day interval ending on the latest day prior to randomization.",

We confirm that all 121 and 123 participants contributed data to the PK outcome measure. The reason why the numbers of participants analyzed per row are different from the overall number of participants is mainly because some PK concentrations at those time points are below LLOQ. Other reasons include: (1) Five participants received accidental dose of Omalizumab at the OLE Week52 thus are excluded for PK sample results for OLE Week64 and OLE Week76, and (2) One participant received omalizumab as concomitant medication in the follow-up period and is excluded from PK sample results for OLE Week76.",
