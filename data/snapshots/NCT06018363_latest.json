      "briefSummary": "B7-H3 is expressed at low levels in normal tissues but overexpressed in various tumor tissues. The ubiquitous expression of B7-H3 in tumors of different grades is a key feature for brain gliomas. The immunohistochemistry study showed that B7-H3 is abundantly expressed on both glioma (especially high-grade glioma) cells and tumor-associated endothelial cells. For GBM, the expression of B7-H3 is intensely positive, especially on tumor cells and vascular endothelial cells, which makes B7-H3 a potential immunotherapeutic target.\n\nγδ T cells recognize tumor cells without being restricted by MHC molecules, and thus can be used in allogeneic therapy without the risk of causing graft-versus-host disease.\n\nThis study is an open-label, single-arm, dose-escalation and dose-expansion clinical study aimed at evaluating the safety and efficacy of allogeneic B7-H3 CAR γδT in patients with malignant glioma."
