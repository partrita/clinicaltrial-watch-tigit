      "briefSummary": "QLC5508 is a fully humanized IgG1 antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) which specifically binds to B7-H3, a target wildly expressed on solid tumor cells. The objectives of this study are to investigate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and anti-tumor activity of QLC5508 in combination with other anti-cancer agents in patients with advanced solid tumor patients.",
      "detailedDescription": "This is a phase Ib/II, open-label, multi-center, dose-escalation and expansion in Chinese subjects with advanced solid tumors. This study is in design allowing assessment of safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and anti-tumor activity of QLC5508 in combination with other anti-cancer agents.\n\nThe target population of dose escalation part is patients have progressed on or intolerant to available standard therapies, and the dose expansion part will enroll patients who have not received prior treatment for advanced/metastatic disease."
