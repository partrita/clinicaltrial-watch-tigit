This may include any patient requiring cystectomy (or nephroureterectomy to resect tumors), including muscle invasive disease (cT2-4aN0M0). Patients with the following high-risk features who are not candidates for traditional neoadjuvant chemotherapy will be included for this trial: micropapillary, sarcomatoid and plasmacytoid features; 3-D mass on exam under anesthesia (EUA); lymphovascular invasion; hydronephrosis (unless in the opinion of the treating physician, this is not due to tumor); high grade (grade 3) tumors of the ureter, renal pelvis, or tumors in these areas with radiographic abnormality large enough to recognize as an abnormal mass by CT or MRI imaging5; direct invasion of the prostatic stroma or the vaginal wall (i.e. cT4a disease).

If either ppoFEV1 or ppoDLCO is \\<40% or a pneumonectomy is planned, cardiopulmonary exercise testing must be performed and VO2max \\>15 mL/kg/min.\n10. If PFTs were performed before 6 months of planned resection or have not been previously performed, they must be performed during the screening period.\n11.

Women must remain abstinent or use contraceptive methods with a failure rate of \\<1% per year during the treatment period and for up to 23 weeks after the last dose of study drugs dose. Women must refrain from donating eggs during this same period. b. A woman is considered to be of childbearing potential if she is postmenarchal, has not reached a postmenopausal state (\\>12 continuous months of amenorrhea with no identified cause other than menopause), and is not permanently infertile due to surgery (i.e., removal of ovaries, fallopian tubes, and/or uterus) or another cause as determined by the investigator (e.g., Müllerian agenesis). The definition of childbearing potential may be adapted for alignment with local guidelines or regulations. c. Examples of contraceptive methods with a failure rate of \\<1% per year include bilateral tubal ligation, male sterilization, hormonal contraceptives that inhibit ovulation, hormone-releasing intrauterine devices, and copper intrauterine devices.\n\nd. The reliability of sexual abstinence should be evaluated in relation to the duration of the clinical trial and the preferred and usual lifestyle of the patient. Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, or postovulation methods) and withdrawal are not adequate methods of contraception. If required per local guidelines or regulations, locally recognized adequate methods of contraception and information about the reliability of abstinence will be described in the local Informed Consent Form. e.

With a female partner of childbearing potential, men who are not surgically sterile must remain abstinent or use a condom plus an additional contraceptive method that together result in a failure rate of \\<1% per year during the treatment period, for up to 90 days after the final dose of the study drugs. Men must refrain from donating sperm during this same period.\n2. With a pregnant female partner, men must remain abstinent or use a condom during the treatment period for 90 days after the final dose of the study drugs to avoid exposing the embryo.\n3. The reliability of sexual abstinence should be evaluated in relation to the duration of the clinical trial and the preferred and usual lifestyle of the patient. Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, or postovulation methods) and withdrawal are not adequate methods of contraception. If required per local guidelines or regulations, locally recognized adequate methods of contraception and information about the reliability of abstinence will be described in the local Informed Consent Form.\n4. Men who would like to father a child after study treatment initiation should be advised regarding the conservation of sperm prior to treatment because of the possibility of irreversible infertility resulting from drugs used in this study.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n1. Illness or condition that may interfere with a patient's capacity to understand, follow, and/or comply with study procedures\n2. Any prior therapy for urothelial cancer, including immunotherapy, chemotherapy, or radiotherapy\n3. History of leptomeningeal disease\n4.
