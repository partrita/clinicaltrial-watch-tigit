Module 1 will consist of Part 1A (dose escalation). The combination arm (Module 2) will open on agreement with SRC, and will investigate AZD6750 and rilvegostomig, enrolling participants with Stage IV NSCLC who either received at least one line of therapy in metastatic setting or are treatment naïve in metastatic setting and have a PD-L1 expression ≥ 1%. Module 2 will consist of an escalation arm (Module 2A) and an expansion arm (Module 2B).
