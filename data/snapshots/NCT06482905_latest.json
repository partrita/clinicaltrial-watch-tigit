      "detailedDescription": "Eligible subjects will be enrolled into two sequential dose-escalating cohorts (i.e., A and B), and will be administrated TX103. Cohort A will receive TX103 exclusively through intraventricular (ICV) delivery, while cohort B will undergo dual intracavitary (ICT) and ICV delivery. Patients in each individual cohort will receive two TX103 infusions on Day 1 and 8 respectively, followed by a 14-day observation period in a 21-day treatment cycle.\n\nThree escalating dosage levels are planned for each cohort. Both Cohorts A and B will adopt the traditional 3+3 dose escalation design with each dose level enrolled with 3 to 6 patients. The starting dose will be 6 × 10\\^7 CAR+ T cells (i.e., Dose Level 1, DL1). Dose limiting toxicities (DLTs) will be assessed during the first cycle ."
