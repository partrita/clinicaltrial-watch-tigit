      "briefSummary": "This study aims to evaluate the psychometric properties of the Turkish adaptation of the Scale of Food Allergy Anxiety (SOFAA), including both the child-report and parent-report versions. The SOFAA is a validated tool originally developed to assess the specific anxiety related to food allergies. The Turkish versions of the scales will undergo a comprehensive validation process, including assessments of internal consistency, test-retest reliability, and construct validity.\n\nParticipants will include children diagnosed with IgE-mediated food allergies and their primary caregivers. The study will investigate whether the translated scales maintain the original structure and effectively measure food allergy-related anxiety in the Turkish pediatric population. The findings are expected to contribute to clinical assessment practices and research on food allergy-related psychosocial impacts in Turkeyy."
