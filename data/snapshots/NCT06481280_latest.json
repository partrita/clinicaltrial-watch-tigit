      "briefSummary": "The aim of this interventional study is to assess the hypoallergenicity of a new formula in infants having a cow milk allergy (CMA), whatever the type of CMA, meaning in both IgE-mediated and non-IgE-mediated CMA patients.\n\nThis will be tested through a double-blind placebo controlled food challenge (DBPCFC) taking place over 2 or 3 separate days, in hospital.\n\nIf the child tolerates the tested formula during the DBPCFC, he will be fed with the test formula during the second study phase. There will be monthly visit and parents will be asked to fill in diaries.",
      "detailedDescription": "Briefly, on two separate days, the placebo formula and the TEHCF will be introduced at increasing doses under medical supervision, and appearance of allergic symptoms will be witnessed and recorded if any. The week after, and more particularly the 72 hours after each food challenge day, child's parents will be instructed to report to the investigator any delayed reaction that may occur. In case the TEHCF induces an allergic reaction, the child's participation will be ended. Otherwise, the child will enter the second study part, lasting 4 months and during which the usual formula taken by the child will be totally replaced by the TEHCF."
