The daily UAS is the average of the morning and evening scores and the UAS7 is the sum of the daily UAS scores over 7 days.UAS7 score: The sum of the daily UAS scores over 7 days. Range: 0-42. If fewer than 7 but at least 4 daily values were non-missing, the remaining values were imputed to be the average. This is equivalent to multiplying the average of the non missing values by 7. UAS7 score: The sum of the daily UAS scores over 7 days. Range: 0-42. A higher score indicates worse disease.",

(FACS) provides fast, objective and quantitative recording of fluorescent signals from individual cells as well as physical separation of cells of particular interest. A wide range of fluorophores can be used as labels in flow cytometry. Fluorophores are typically attached to an antibody that recognizes a target feature on or in the cell; they may also be attached to a chemical entity with affinity for the cell membrane or another cellular structure. Each fluorophore has a characteristic peak excitation and emission wavelength.",

(FACS) provides fast, objective and quantitative recording of fluorescent signals from individual cells as well as physical separation of cells of particular interest. A wide range of fluorophores can be used as labels in flow cytometry. Fluorophores are typically attached to an antibody that recognizes a target feature on or in the cell; they may also be attached to a chemical entity with affinity for the cell membrane or another cellular structure. Each fluorophore has a characteristic peak excitation and emission wavelength.",

The UAS is a composite eDiary-recorded score with numeric severity intensity ratings on a scale of 0-3 (0 = none to 3 = intense/severe) for 1) the number of wheals (hives); and 2) the intensity of the itch. The daily UAS is the average of the morning and evening scores and the UAS7 is the sum of the daily UAS scores over 7 days.UAS7 score: The sum of the daily UAS scores over 7 days. Range: 0-42. If fewer than 7 but at least 4 daily values were non-missing, the remaining values were imputed to be the average. This is equivalent to multiplying the average of the non missing values by 7.

Patients rated their dermatology symptoms as well as the impact of their skin condition on various aspects of their lives. An overall score was calculated as well as for the following domains: Symptoms and Feelings, Daily Activities, Leisure, Work and School, Personal Relationships, Treatment.Negative score shows positive efficacy. Meaning of DLQI Scores 0-1 = no effect at all on patient's life 2-5 = small effect on patient's life 6-10 = moderate effect on patient's life 11-20 = very large effect on patient's life 21-30 = extremely large effect on patient's life. The DLQI is calculated by summing the score of each question resulting in a maximum of 30 and a minimum of 0. The higher the score, the more quality of life is impaired. The DLQI can also be expressed as a percentage of the maximum possible score of 30.",
