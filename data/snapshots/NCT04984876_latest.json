      "briefSummary": "This was a 52-week, Phase 3 multi-center, randomized, double-blind and placebo-controlled study to assess the safety and clinical efficacy of two dosing regimens of ligelizumab (240 mg and 120 mg) SC q4w (subcutaneous injection every 4 weeks) in participants with a medically confirmed diagnosis of Immunoglobulin E (IgE) mediated peanut allergy.",
      "detailedDescription": "Participants were randomized to ligelizumab 240 mg, ligelizumab 120 mg, or placebo (5 treatment arms, randomization ratio of 2:2:2:2:1) for the double-blind placebo-controlled treatment period (up to Week 12).\n\nParticipants initially assigned to the 8-week placebo arms received the first dose of blinded ligelizumab treatment at the Week 8 visit. Participants initially assigned to the 16-week placebo arm received the last dose of placebo before the Double Blind Placebo Controlled Food Challenge (DBPCFC) at Week 12 and the first dose of blinded ligelizumab treatment at the Week 16 visit.\n\nAt the start of the study, recruitment was restricted to 12-55-year-old participants. After approximately 60 adolescent participants (defined as 12-17 yrs of age) had completed all Week 12 assessments, an interim analysis (IA1) on Pharmacokinetics (PK) and selected Pharmacodynamics (PD) data (total IgE and basophil bound High affinity immunoglobulin E receptor 1 (FcƐRI)) was performed (safety was reviewed by a Data Monitoring Committee - DMC). Independent sponsor members who were responsible for PK/ PD data analysis and Modeling \\& Simulation were unblinded to the results of this interim analysis. The planned intent of this analysis was to confirm the dosing strategy for the youngest age group, 6-11 yrs and once the dose was to be confirmed, recruitment was supposed to be open for this age group. However, Novartis made a strategic decision to close recruitment in the study CQGE031G12301 and to terminate the study early, once all eligible participants in the study had completed week 12 assessments and the 16-week safety follow-up period. This decision was based on a blinded data review, which showed evidence of efficacy without the detection of any safety signal and that efficacy may be optimized with a different dosing regimen. Due to this decision, the final population size was 211, with only adolescent and adult participants (12 - 17yrs, and 18 - 55yrs) recruited."

          "description": "The Skin Prick Test (SPT) is a widely used diagnostic tool for identifying allergen-specific IgE-mediated allergies. During the test, a small amount of allergen, in this case, peanut allergen, is introduced into the skin. The allergen interacts with specific IgE antibodies bound to cutaneous mast cells. This interaction can cause a reaction, resulting in a wheal and flare on the skin. The size of the wheal and flare, specifically the longest diameter and the midpoint orthogonal diameter, were evaluated at each site and the average size of the wheal and flare across all sites was summarized and reported. Considering the study termination, SPT originally scheduled at Week 56 was performed 4 weeks after Week 12 assessment in some patients.",

The questionnaire includes three domains (Emotional Impact (EI), Allergen Avoidance and Dietary Restrictions (AADR) and Risk of Accidental Exposure (RAE)). Each item is scored on a 7-point scale (coded as 1-7 in analysis), with a higher score indicating greater impairment in HRQoL. The total score and the domain scores are calculated as the arithmetic average of all completed items. If more than one item in any domain is missing, a domain score should not be calculated for that case. However, a total score could still be calculated if 20% or fewer of the items are missing. Therefore, the range for each item, domain, and the total score is from 1 (minimum) to 7 (maximum). The higher the score, the greater the impairment in HRQoL.",

The questionnaire includes four domains (Emotional Impact (EI), Allergen Avoidance and Dietary Restrictions (AADR), Risk of Accidental Exposure (RAE) and Food Allergy Related Health (FAH)). Each item is scored on a 7-point scale (coded as 1-7 in analysis), with a higher score indicating greater impairment in HRQoL. The total score and the domain scores are calculated as the arithmetic average of all completed items. If more than one item in any domain is missing, a domain score should not be calculated for that case. However, a total score could still be calculated if 20% or fewer of the items are missing. Therefore, the range for each item, domain, and the total score is from 1 (minimum) to 7 (maximum). The higher the score, the greater the impairment in HRQoL.",

          "description": "The Food Allergy Independent Measure (FAIM) - Teenager Form (FAIM-TF) is a self-reported instrument designed for adolescents aged 13-17. It aims to reflect the participant's perceived food allergy severity and food allergy-related risk.\n\nThe questionnaire consists of six questions; The first four questions assess the participant's food allergy expectation outcomes and the remaining two questions reflect aspects of the perceived severity of food allergy. Each question is scored on a 7-point scale (coded as 1-7 in analysis), with a greater score indicating a higher level of perceived risk or chance of adverse events occurring. The total score is calculated as the arithmetic average of all completed items. If less than 80% of the items within the score are complete, the total score is not calculated. Therefore, the range for each item and the total score is from 1 (minimum) to 7 (maximum). The higher the score, the greater the perceived risk or chance of adverse events occurring.",

          "description": "The Food Allergy Independent Measure (FAIM) - Adult Form (FAIM-AF) is a self-reported instrument designed for adults aged 18-55. It aims to reflect the participant's perceived food allergy severity and food allergy-related risk.\n\nThe questionnaire consists of six questions; The first four questions assess the participant's food allergy expectation outcomes and the remaining two questions reflect aspects of the perceived severity of food allergy. Each question is scored on a 7-point scale (coded as 1-7 in analysis), with a greater score indicating a higher level of perceived risk or chance of adverse events occurring. The total score is calculated as the arithmetic average of all completed items. If less than 80% of the items within the score are complete, the total score is calculated. Therefore, the range for each item and the total score is from 1 (minimum) to 7 (maximum). The higher the score, the greater the perceived risk or chance of adverse events occurring.",

It is designed for use in surveys of general and specific populations, health policy evaluations and clinical practice and research. It contains 8 scales and 2 component summary indices evaluating physical, social and emotional functioning in addition to general health perceptions and mental health. Responses to items allow for direct calculation of scale scores, while the physical component summary (PCS) and mental component summary (MCS) scores are computed from weighted scale scores. For all scales and summary measures, higher scores indicate better health outcomes (PCS and MCS scores range 0 to 100).",
