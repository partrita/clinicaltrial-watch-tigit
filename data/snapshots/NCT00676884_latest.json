Subjects should continue their concomitant treatments for medical conditions (other than eczema).\n* Subjects who are able and willing to give written informed consent.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Subjects who do not conform to the above inclusion criteria.\n* Subjects who have the following medical conditions: Diabetes mellitus, Thyroiditis, Rheumatiod arthritis, Multiple sclerosis, Uveitis, Sarcoidosis, Glomerulonephritis, Helminthic infection.\n* Subjects who have a history of relevant drug hypersensitivity.\n* Subjects who have a history of alcoholism.\n* Subjects who have a history of drug abuse.\n* Subjects who have a significant infection at the time of screening and/or admission.\n* Subjects who are having acute gastrointestinal symptoms at the time of screening and/or admission (e.g. nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, heartburn), may be asked to reschedule their screening and/or admission to when they are not longer having acute symptoms.\n* Subjects who have an acute infection such as influenza at the time of screening and/or admission.\n* Female subjects who are not using an acceptable method of contraception.\n* Subjects who have used any investigational drug and /or participated in any clinical trial within 3 months of their first dosing.\n* Subjects who have previously received AeroDerm.\n* Subjects using medication, which in the opinion of the Investigator will affect the outcome of the study.\n* Subjects who have donated and/or received any blood or blood products within the previous 3 months prior to first dosing (to review on a case by case basis).\n* Subjects who cannot communicate reliably with the investigator.\n* Subjects who are unlikely to co-operate with the requirements of the study.",
