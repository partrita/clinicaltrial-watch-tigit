      "detailedDescription": "This drug(YH35324) is currently under development as a novel therapeutic agent for various IgE-mediated allergic diseases. Since YH35324 exhibits high binding affinity to human IgE, it prevents serum IgE from binding to receptors on mast cells and basophils, thereby inhibiting histamine release via degranulation following allergen exposures. In addition, YH35324 suppresses autoantibody-dependent effector cell activation by blocking anti-FcεRIα autoantibodies. This study aims to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK), and pharmacodynamics (PD) following a single subcutaneous injection of YH35324 in subjects with various allergic diseases."

Therefore, the treatment group information of subjects will be checked through IWRS with limited access before administration of the IP, and only study pharmacists and unblinded staff are allowed to access the system.\n\nThe study pharmacists and unblinded staff should not disclose the assigned treatment group of enrolled subjects to the principal investigator or study staff.",
