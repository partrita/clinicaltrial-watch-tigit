      "detailedDescription": "Food allergy is a reproducible specific immune response to exposure to a given food. Cow's milk protein allergy (CMPA) is clinically abnormal reaction to cow's milk protein (CMP) via immune mechanisms triggered by milk protein (Boyce etal.,2010).\n\nAccording to European academy for allergy and clinical immunology (EAACI) and the world allergy organization (wao) , a hypersensitivity reaction to cow's milk involving the immune system can be called as CMPA. There is difference between CMPA and non-allergic cow's milk intolerance (e.g lactose intolerance) which occurs as a result of lactase deficiency without involvement of the immune system (Venter etal.,2013).\n\nCMPA is categorized into immunoglobulin IgE mediated , non -IgE mediated ,or mixed CMPA (Sicherer etal.,2001).\n\n1.9% to 4.9% prevalence of CMPA among children with a peak in prevalence (2-3%) in the first year of life and prevalence of \\<1% in children aged \\>=6 years (koletzko etal.,2012)."
