      "briefSummary": "Allergic rhinitis (AR) affects large population worldwide, the most commonly used medication include anti-histamine, nasal spray and anti-LTRAs inhibitors (leukotriene receptor antagonists), Even after those first-line treatment, there is still a large number of patient (\\~20%) are not well/adequately controlled. Anti-IgE antibody has been approved to treat moderate to severe AR by PMDA/Japan in 2020, demonstrating the efficacy of IgE blockade in the treatment of allergic rhinitis. The current study presents a novel anti-IgE antibody (LP-003) with higher affinity to IgE, stronger efficacy and longer half-life.",
      "detailedDescription": "The purpose of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of LP-003 in combination with SoC (nasal corticosteroids and/or anti-histamine) in adult patients with Moderate to Severe Seasonal Allergic Rhinitis, whose symptoms were inadequately controlled despite the current recommended therapies (nasal corticosteroids and/or anti-histamine) in the previous 2 pollen seasons."
