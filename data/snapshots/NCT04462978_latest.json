      "briefSummary": "Non-IgE-mediated gastrointestinal food allergies (non-IgE-GIFA) are an evolving web of clinical conditions characterized by subacute and/or chronic symptoms and include food protein-induced enterocolitis syndrome (FPIES), food protein-induced enteropathy (FPE), food protein-induced allergic proctocolitis (FPIAP), and food protein-induced allergic dysmotility disorders (gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), colic and constipation) (FPIMD).\n\nDespite the prevalence and clinical impact of these conditions, the pathogenesis as well as the natural history and the best management of these disorders are still poorly defined. These limitations could be responsible for diagnostic delays and errors, and suboptimal clinical management. We aim to evaluate clinical features, natural course and pathophysiology of non-IgE-GIFA in the pediatric age."
