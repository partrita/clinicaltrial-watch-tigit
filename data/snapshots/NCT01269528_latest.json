Our group has shown that the determination of PC20 by spirometry is feasible in preschool children. MCT is considered safe in this age group and our group has extensive experience with no adverse events. In the current study MCT will be performed (for the first time) in premature babies born at 30-32 weeks of gestation during 2008-2009 when they reach the age of 3-4 years (2011 and 2012, respectively). The results of MCT of the two groups will be compared.",
