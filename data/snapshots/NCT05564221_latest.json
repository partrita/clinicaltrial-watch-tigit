      "detailedDescription": "YH35324 is a drug under development as a novel therapeutic agent for various IgE-mediated allergic diseases. Since YH35324 has a high binding affinity to human IgE, it prevents serum IgE from binding to receptors on mast cells and basophil, thereby inhibiting histamine release caused by degranulation when exposed to allergens. This study aims to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic (PD) profiles following multiple subcutaneous injections of YH35324 in healthy subjects or subjects with allergic diseases, who have atopy."
