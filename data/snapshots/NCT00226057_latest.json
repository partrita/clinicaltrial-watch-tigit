      "briefSummary": "The purpose of this study is to determine if Raptiva will have beneficial effects in the treatment of patients with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis.",
      "detailedDescription": "Atopic dermatitis is a common, highly pruritic, inflammatory skin disease that affects up to 17% of school-aged children. Most cases of childhood atopic dermatitis improve or resolve by adulthood. However, the majority of patients retain some features of atopic dermatitis and some continue to have severe disease that continues to adulthood. Moderate to severe atopic dermatitis cannot be adeuately controlled with topical agents. Consequently many patients are treated with systemic corticosteroids, cyclosporine, azathioprine, methotrexate, and other immunosuppressants that carry the risk of severe atopic dermatitis is greatly needed. The chronic use of current immunosuppressive agents is limited by cumulative end-organ toxicities. We propose inhibition of T cell trafficking to the skin with Raptiva will have beneficial effects in the treatment of patients with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis."
