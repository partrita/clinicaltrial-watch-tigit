      "briefSummary": "The CASCADES study will investigate the safety and efficacy of sublingual immunotherapy (SLIT) for the treatment of cashew allergy in children ages 1-11 years old. Primary efficacy will be assessed after 18 months of cashew SLIT. Lab studies and an oral food challenge after 6 months of cashew SLIT will help determine how quickly cashew SLIT begins to take effect.",
      "detailedDescription": "The CASCADES study is an 18-month randomized, placebo-controlled trial of cashew sublingual immunotherapy (CASHEW SLIT) in children 1-11 years of age with cashew allergy . Children ages 1-11 years with double-blind placebo-controlled food challenge (DBPCFC) proven allergy to cashew randomized 2:1 to active cashew SLIT or placebo. Participants will undergo a 5-month dose buildup period followed by a DBPCFC at month 6. Participants will then complete an additional 12 months of maintenance cashew SLIT or placebo followed by a DBPCFC at month 18. Safety will be assessed throughout the study. Skin prick testing (SPT), blood sampling, and saliva collection will be performed at baseline and at months 1, 3, 6, 12, and 18 to evaluate for immune biomarker changes."
