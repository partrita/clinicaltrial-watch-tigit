      "briefSummary": "By hypothesising that Interstitial Cystitis is an allergic disorder of the urogenital system that is linked to mast-cells, current therapy with omalizumab may represent a potential non symptomatic strategy for the treatment of IC/BPS",
      "detailedDescription": "Interstitial cystitis/Bladder Pain Syndrome is a chronic inflammatory disease of the bladder, that is characterized by pain in the pelvic region and a frequent need to urinate. So far there is not a an effective treatment for this uncommon distressing condition.\n\nThe objective of this preliminary study was to evaluate the efficacy of omalizumab in the treatment of Interstitial Cystitis/Bladder Pain Syndrome, evaluated by visual analogue score (VAS) for pain and urgency- frequency, O'Leary-Sant IC symptom and problem index questionnaire (primary outcome), PUF questionnaire and Patient Global Assessment questionnaire, and urination diary (secondary outcomes).\n\nThree female adult patients (24-34 years) suffering form Interstitial Cystitis and chronic bladder pain were included in the study. The omalizumab dose has been calculated on the basis of body weight and basal levels of total serum IgE. Treatment was administered subcutaneously every 2 or 4 weeks (according to the calculated total dose) for a total of 48 weeks. Each vial contained 150 mg of the active compound, therefore the number of injections for each administration varied between 1 and 3, depending on the total dose used. Patients were allowed to take drugs used for IC (Fibrase, Pelvilen, Normast, Quercetin, Chondroitin, Glucosamine per os). During the screening process, the dosage of these drugs was established and stably maintained during the 4 week run-in period."
