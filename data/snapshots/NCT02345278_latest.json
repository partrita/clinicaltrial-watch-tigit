      "briefSummary": "Allergic rhinitis/rhinoconjunctivitis is a symptomatic disorder of the nose induced by an immunoglobulin E (IgE) mediated inflammatory response. Treatment may involve pharmacotherapy and specific immunotherapy (IT). IT represents the only treatment that might alter the natural course of the disease. The amount of administered allergen is crucial for both efficacy and safety of specific IT. SUBLIVAC FIX Mite mixture is a preparation for sublingual IT (SLIT) and is indicated for the treatment of allergic disorders such as allergic rhinitis and rhinoconjunctivitis, caused by sensitisation to house dust mite (HDM) allergens.\n\nAccording to the European Medicines Agency Guideline on the clinical development of products for specific IT for the treatment of allergic diseases, products should be tested at different dosages to provide preliminary data on safety and tolerability with regard to the maximum tolerated dose and suitable dose escalation scheme. This trial is designed to investigate the tolerability and safety of different dosages of SUBLIVAC FIX Mite mixture."
