A significant disease is defined as a disease which in the opinion of the investigator may either put the patient at risk because of participation in the study or a disease which may influence the results of the study or the patient's ability to participate in the study.\n* Patients with a respiratory tract infection in the past 4 weeks prior to Visit 2.\n* Pregnant or nursing women or women of childbearing potential not using a medically approved means of contraception (i.e., oral contraceptives, intrauterine devices, diaphragm, or subdermal implants).\n* Known autoimmune or collagen disease\n* Cardiovascular disease\n* Perennial pulmonary disease including asthma\n* Hepatic disease\n* Known renal insufficiency\n* Cancer\n* Hematologic disease\n* Chronic infectious disease\n* Any medication with a possible side-effect of interfering with the immune response\n* Previous immuno- or chemotherapy, apart from SCIT\n* Disease or conditions rendering the treatment of anaphylactic reactions difficult (symptomatic coronary heart diseases, severe arterial hypertension and treatment with β-blockers)\n* Major metabolic disease\n* Known or suspected allergy to the study product\n* Obesity with BMI \\> 30 since subcutaneous fat makes ultrasound imaging of lymph nodes harder which may risk the correct placement of injection.\n* Patients who, in the opinion of the investigator, abuse alcohol or drugs within 2 years prior to Visit 1.\n* Patients who have taken an investigational drug within 1 month or six half lives, whichever is greater, prior to Visit 1.\n* Mental incapability of coping with the study\n* Withdrawal of informed consent",
