      "briefSummary": "This phase II trial tests how well cemiplimab and transarterial radioembolization (TARE) with yttrium-90 (Y90) SIR-Spheres, registered trademark, works in treating breast cancer that has spread from where it first started (primary site) to the liver (metastatic). Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as cemiplimab, may help the body's immune system attack the tumor, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. TARE is a treatment that uses radioactive microspheres, such as Y90 SIR-S Spheres, to both cause hepatic artery embolization and to deliver regional radiotherapy. Y90 SIR-S Spheres is an injectable form of the radioisotope yttrium Y 90 encapsulated in resin microspheres. When injected into the artery supplying the tumor, yttrium Y 90 resin microspheres block the tumor blood vessels and deliver the yttrium Y 90 directly to the tumor site, which may kill or slow tumor growth. Giving cemiplimab and Y90 SIR-Spheres by TARE to the tumor in the liver may kill more tumor cells in patients with metastatic breast cancer.",
      "detailedDescription": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:\n\nI. To describe the effect of cemiplimab and yttrium Y90 resin microspheres (90Y TARE) on immune activation in the treated tumor based on CD8+ T cells.\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To evaluate other measures of changes (both in treated and untreated lesions after the first TARE treatment) in the tumor microenvironment (TME) of 10 metastatic breast cancer (MBC) patients with liver-dominant disease.\n\nII. To identify systemic immune activation in the peripheral blood. III. To determine the safety and tolerability of cemiplimab and hepatic radioembolization in patients with liver dominant metastatic breast cancer using Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 5.0 criteria.\n\nIV. To evaluate objective tumor response of the target lesion treated with Y90 by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1 and modified RECIST (mRECIST).\n\nOUTLINE:\n\nPatients receive cemiplimab intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on day 1 of each cycle. Cycles repeat every 21 days for up to 1 year in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients receive Y90 SIR-Spheres intratumorally via TARE over 60-90 minutes once during days 7-14 and on day 67. Patients also undergo tumor biopsy at baseline and at day 42 after immunotherapy begins. Additionally patients also undergo blood sample collection and computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) throughout the study.\n\nAfter completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days, every 3 months within 1 year of start of treatment, and then every 6 months for up to 2 years."

Participants must remain on anti-viral therapy for at least 6 months beyond the last dose of investigational study medication\n  * Participants with HBsAg negative but total hepatitis B core antibody (HBcAb) positive are permitted with the following requirements: If serum HBV DNA PCR is above the limit of detection at screening, initiate HBV antiviral therapy before study entry. If serum HBV DNA PCR is below the limit of detection, periodic monitoring of HBsAg must be performed\n  * Participants who are hepatitis C virus (HCV) antibody positive (Ab+) who have controlled infection (undetectable HCV RNA by PCR either spontaneously or in response to a successful prior course of anti-HCV therapy) are eligible\n* Receipt of a live vaccine within 4 weeks of start of study medication\n* Receipt of COVID-19 vaccination within 1 week of planned start of study medication or for which the planned COVID-19 vaccinations would not be completed 1 week prior to start of study medication\n* Known hypersensitivity to the active substances or to any of the excipients\n* Women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) and men who are unwilling to practice highly effective contraception prior to the initial dose/start of the first treatment, during the study, and for at least 6 months after the last dose. Highly effective contraceptive measures include:\n\n  * Stable use of combined (estrogen and progestogen containing) hormonal contraception (oral, intravaginal, transdermal) or progestogen-only hormonal contraception (oral, injectable, implantable) associated with inhibition of ovulation initiated 2 or more menstrual cycles prior to screening;\n  * Intrauterine device; intrauterine hormone-releasing system;\n  * Bilateral tubal occlusion/ligation;\n  * Vasectomized partner (provided that the male vasectomized partner is the sole sexual partner of the WOCBP study participant and that the vasectomized partner has obtained medical assessment of surgical success for the procedure); and/or\n  * Sexual abstinence\n  * Pregnancy testing and contraception are required for WOCBP. Pregnancy testing and contraception are not required for women who are postmenopausal or permanently sterile\n  * WOCBP are defined as women who are fertile following menarche until becoming postmenopausal, unless permanently sterile. Permanent sterilization methods include hysterectomy, bilateral salpingectomy, and bilateral oophorectomy\n  * A postmenopausal state is defined as no menses for 12 months without an alternative medical cause. A high follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) level in the postmenopausal range may be used to confirm a postmenopausal state in women not using hormonal contraception or hormonal replacement therapy. However, in the absence of 12 months of amenorrhea, a single FSH measurement is insufficient to determine the occurrence of a postmenopausal state. The above definitions are according to the Clinical Trials Facilitation and Coordination Group (CTFG) guidance. Pregnancy testing and contraception are not required for women with documents hysterectomy or tubal ligation\n  * Male participants: A male participant will be excluded from the study if that participant does not agree to use condoms or practice sexual abstinence, unless vasectomized, prior to the initial dose/start of study medication, during the study, and for at least 6 months after the last dose. Sperm donation is also prohibited during the same period. Vasectomy success must be confirmed by semen analysis\n  * Sexual abstinence is considered a highly effective method only if defined as refraining from heterosexual intercourse during the entire period of risk associated with the study drugs. The reliability of sexual abstinence needs to be evaluated in relation to the duration of the clinical trial and the preferred and usual lifestyle of the participant\n* Periodic abstinence (calendar, symptothermal, post-ovulation methods), withdrawal (coitus interruptus), spermicides only, and lactational amenorrhea method are not acceptable methods of contraception. Female condom and male condom should not be used together",
