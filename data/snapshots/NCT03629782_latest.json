It is anticipated that these data from European countries, will help to estimate the unmet need for better treatments in severe asthma patients and will provide supporting evidence on the current shortcomings in referrals to asthma specialist or secondary care clinics. This information could also support the development of better severe asthma care pathways across Europe.\n\nApproximately 1,500 other patients like you will take part in the RECOGNISE study."
