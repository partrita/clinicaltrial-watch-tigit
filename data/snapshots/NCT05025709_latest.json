      "briefSummary": "Bronchospasm during anaesthesia is a rare but potentially life-threatening event. They are classically part of IgE-dependent anaphylaxis but can also occur as an independent clinical entity, triggered by inflammatory factors such as smoking, chronic bronchitis, asthma, overweight and mechanical factors such as tracheal intubation.\n\nThe etiological diagnosis is currently established during an allergy-anaesthesia consultation after skin testing for drugs used for induction of anaesthesia and antibiotic therapy when it is attributable.\n\nThe aim of this study was to determine the characteristics that differ between 2 groups: isolated non-allergic bronchospasm and bronchospasm as part of an immediate allergic hypersensitivity reaction."
