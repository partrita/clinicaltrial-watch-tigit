      "briefSummary": "This study is designed to assess the efficacy and safety of ifinatamab deruxtecan (I-DXD) in the following tumor types: endometrial cancer (EC); head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC); pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC); colorectal cancer (CRC); hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC); adenocarcinoma of esophagus, gastroesophageal junction, and stomach (Ad-Eso/GEJ/gastric); urothelial carcinoma (UC); ovarian cancer (OVC); cervical cancer (CC); biliary tract cancer (BTC); human epidermal growth factor 2 (HER2)-low breast cancer (BC); HER2 immunohistochemistry (IHC) 0 BC; and cutaneous melanoma.",
      "detailedDescription": "This study will evaluate the efficacy and safety of I-DXd in participants with recurrent or metastatic solid tumors previously treated with 1 or more systemic therapies for the selected tumor indication. The study will be divided into 2 parts: Stage 1 and Stage 2. Each cohort starts with Stage 1 and may continue to Stage 2 if sufficient safety and efficacy data are observed.\n\nThe HCC Safety Run-In (Phase 1) will assess the safety and tolerability of I-DXd in participants with HCC."
