      "briefSummary": "This study will evaluate the efficacy and safety of atezolizumab plus tiragolumab or atezolizumab alone following neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (nCRT) in participants with locally advanced rectal cancer (LARC). The study consists of a safety run-in phase and a randomization phase. Participants enrolled in the safety run-in phase will receive atezolizumab + tiragolumab following nCRT. Upon determination of the safety of the treatment regimen, the study will be proceed to the randomization phase. Participants will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to the atezolizumab + tiragolumab arm or atezolizumab arm."
