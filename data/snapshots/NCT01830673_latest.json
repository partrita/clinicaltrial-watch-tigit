      "briefSummary": "The primary endpoint was the induction of T-regulatory cells under s specific subcutaneous immunotherapy (SCIT). Patients suffering from grass pollen allergy (relevant clinical symptomes during the pollen season, Skin Prick test diamter \\>4mm or RAST class II or higher) were included. The patients were allocated to three study groups:\n\nGroup 1: during and directly after SCIT (after completion the 2nd or 3rd year of treatment) Group 2: completed SCIT more then three years ago Group 3: Patients with clinically relevant grass pollen allergy without SCIT.\n\nThe investigators analyzed the lung function parameters, exhaled NO (eNO) and asked the patients to record symptoms during the adjacent pollen season. A blood sample was drawn to analyze the amount of TH1 and TH2 and regulatory T-cells, inflammatory markers(IL-2, IL-5, IL-10, IL-12/23, TNF-alpha, IFN-gamma) and blocking antibodies (IgG, IgG4)."
