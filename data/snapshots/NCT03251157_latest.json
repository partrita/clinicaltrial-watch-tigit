      "briefSummary": "The Nutrition Study of the GA2LEN Follow-Survey was designed to investigate the association between usual dietary intake and allergic and respiratory outcomes in adults across Europe. Within this framework, a food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) was designed to ascertain usual dietary intake of 250 food items, which was translated into the languages of the participant centres. Information on daily intake of foods, nutrients, and flavonoids was derived.",
      "detailedDescription": "Within the GA2LEN Follow-up Survey, the Nutrition Survey was aimed at assessing dietary intake in adults across European countries and its association with various outcomes of allergy and respiratory health. In absence of an internationally comparable dietary questionnaire to ascertain usual dietary intake, a single and standardized food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) was design to be used as a common instrument in all participant countries. The FFQ is comprised of 32 food sections and 250 food items. The FFQ sections were designed following the recommendations by the EFCOSUM Group, which facilitate international comparisons of dietary intake. It also included several staple foods to capture locally representative dietary intake.\n\nParticipants reported how often they had consumed each of the foods over the previous month, using eight predefined options (rarely or never, 1-3 times per month, once, 2-4, or 5-6 times per week, once, 2-3 times per day). Standard food portion sizes were used to quantify the intake following the recommendations from the UK's Food Standards Agency. Daily intake of foods (g) were estimated and macro- and micronutrient and flavonoid intakes were derived. The GA2LEN FFQ was validated in five EU countries, namely Finland, UK, Portugal, Germany, Poland, and Greece, and demonstrated to be a good tool to assess mid-term intake of foods, specifically essential polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs). The instrument has also been demonstrated to be an accurate tool to assess dietary sources of flavonoids.\n\nVarious approaches were planned to derive dietary exposures and to examine their association with respiratory and allergic outcomes. These included the use of dietary patterns derived from Principal Component Analysis (PCA), a dietary inflammatory index (DII), as well as single antioxidants, and individual food items."

A random sample of eligible participants who indicated a willingness to be re-contacted was selected based on their responses to the initial postal survey. The cases were participants who either had asthma, sinusitis or both and the controls (who lived in the same areas) were those who reported having neither. Each center recruited up to 120 cases each of patients with asthma only, CRS only, controls and 40 patients with both asthma and CRS based on the responses to the initial cross-sectional survey.",
