      "briefSummary": "The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the effect of dosing regimens of multiple subcutaneous (SC) doses of rAvPAL-PEG to induce an early and sustained Phe reduction while decreasing the frequency and severity of hypersensitivity reactions in patients with PKU.",
      "detailedDescription": "The primary rationale for this study is to define an optimal rAvPAL-PEG dose regimen by establishing the therapeutic effect within the shortest time possible time for induction, titration and maintenance phases while reducing the severity and frequency of hypersensitivity reactions that may lead to dose interruptions. It is hypothesized that these goals can be achieved by keeping rAvPAL-PEG doses low when anti-PEG IgM response is predicted to be high and titrating to an efficacious dose once the IgG response to PAL has developed. Further investigation is needed to determine how early and quickly patients can titrate safely to lower blood Phe; therefore, this protocol proposes to assess two Groups using an induction/titration and maintenance schedule with an aim towards establishing the therapeutic effect safety within an optimal period of time."

Patients with a prior systemic reaction of generalized rash may be eligible for participation per the discretion of the Principal Investigator in consultation with the Sponsor's Medical Officer.\n5. Pregnant or breastfeeding at Screening or planning to become pregnant (self or partner) or to breastfeed at any time during the study.\n6. Concurrent disease or condition that would interfere with study participation or safety (eg, history or presence of clinically significant cardiovascular, pulmonary, hepatic, renal, hematologic, gastrointestinal, endocrine, immunologic, dermatologic, neurological, oncologic, or psychiatric disease).\n7. Any condition that, in the view of the PI, places the patient at high risk of poor treatment compliance or of not completing the study.\n8. Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) concentration \\> 2 times the upper limit of normal.\n9. Creatinine \\> 1.5 times the upper limit of normal.\n10. A positive test for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) antibody, hepatitis B surface antigen and hepatitis C antibody.",
