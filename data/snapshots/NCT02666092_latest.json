      "briefSummary": "Anisakidae frequently infect fish species that are commonly eaten by humans. Some of them are recognized as zoonotic diseases agents, and have a high impact on human health.\n\nInfestation results from the ingestion of living larvae from contaminated fishes. It can be asymptomatic or symptomatic, resulting in acute gastric, acute intestinal or chronic forms. Allergic manifestations are frequently encountered in gastric forms, but allergic symptoms can also occur in isolation, after ingestion of Anisakidae antigens contained in raw or cooked fish, and may masquerade as fish allergy.\n\nIn this study, we aim to characterize the relationship between Anisakidae and/or fish sensitization and the presence of allergic manifestations in patients recruited in the general population and presenting fish allergy resulting from ingestion, cutaneous or respiratory contact. We will also determine the respective role of Anisakidae or fish sensitization in patients with fish allergy. Then, we will determine the prevalence of previous Anisakidae infections among these patients and a matched control population. We will also compare the performances of serological tests (ImmunoCAP, immunoelectrophoresis and Western Blot) for the diagnosis of Anisakidae allergy or infection. Lastly, we will explore the relationship between domestic exposure to Anisakidae or fish antigens and the occurrence of associated pathologies (Anisakidae or fish allergy/sensitization; Anisakidae infection).",
      "detailedDescription": "First, 51 patients with fish allergy will be recruited from the Parasitology-Mycology and Immunology Laboratories of Lille University Hospital databases (serology for anti-Anisakis or anti-fish detection). Then, clinical (characteristics of allergic manifestations) and epidemiological (domestic exposure to fish) data will be collected, and anti-fish or Anti-Anisakis antibodies will be detected using ImmunoCAP (IgE), or ImmunoCAP, immunoelectrophoresis, Western Blot, respectively. Similar serological tests will be performed for a control group of 51 matched subjects who will be recruited among Lille University Hospital workers."
