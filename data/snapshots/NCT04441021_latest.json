      "briefSummary": "Children are often reported to have antibiotics allergies, with approximately 10% of the US population labeled as allergic to an antibiotic. Recent studies have demonstrated that a large majority of children with a penicillin allergy label do not have a true IgE-mediated allergy. Appropriately delabeling antibiotic allergies has been shown to improve patient care outcomes and lower health care costs. However, efforts to implement these assessments in practice are lacking, particularly in the hospital setting. Therefore, there is a need for hospital-based risk assessment and delabeling strategies for hospitalized children. The investigator's objective is to determine the feasibility of implementing a hospital-based approach to penicillin allergy risk stratification and evaluation of patients at low-risk for true allergy."
