      "briefSummary": "Background : Allergen Immunotherapy (AIT) is the only etiological treatment for allergic respiratory diseases. In order to improve the competence on the use of AIT, it is important to extend the investigator's knowledge on its use in routine clinical practice, outside the experimental setting of clinical trials, in real life population of patients receiving AIT.\n\nObjective: To evaluate the clinical criteria used by treating clinicians and by the patients themselves, when establishing AIT as treatment in a patient with respiratory disease caused by an IgE-dependent-hypersensitivity to aeroallergens Methods: In 6 country (Denmark, France, Germany, Norway, Spain \\& Sweden), the national coordinator will be directly responsible for selection of Survey Doctor's participants (Investigators).\n\nDuring 12 months:\n\n* Firstly, each investigator will complete the Survey Doctor, online, on SurveyMonkey platform to explain what are the key drivers in Allergen Immunotherapy (AIT) selection (Doctors' Questionnaire, DQ).\n* On the other hand, at each AIT prescription to a patient, doctors will complete the Survey Patient, on the same platform, to explain how and why they have chosen this type of AIT (Patients' Questionnaire, PQ)."
