Teplizumab-treated and placebo-treated participants in the NIH trial who developed clinical type 1 diabetes after the conclusion of that trial, were eligible to enroll and receive teplizumab treatment within one year of diagnosis of clinical type 1 diabetes.",
      "detailedDescription": "The study was a single-arm, multicenter, open-label clinical trial. All participants received a 12-day course of teplizumab given through daily IV infusion and were followed for 78 weeks.\n\nThe purpose of this study was to evaluate the safety and tolerability of teplizumab treatment, administered intravenously (IV) to participants in the NIH-sponsored trial who have developed type 1 diabetes and were able to start teplizumab treatment within 1 year of diagnosis of type 1 diabetes. Whether teplizumab treatment reduced the loss of insulin-producing pancreatic beta cells were evaluated."
