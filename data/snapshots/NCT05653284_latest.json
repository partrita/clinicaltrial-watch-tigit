Histologically or cytologically documented unresectable advanced or metastatic malignant tumor that has failed or intolerant of standard therapy, or for which no effective standard therapy is available.\n5. Subject must have at least one measurable lesion according to RECIST Version1.1.\n6. Adequate organ function.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n1. Any malignancy other than the disease under study within the past 3 years except for radically cured local cancers, such as basal cell skin cancer, carcinoma in situ of the cervix, or carcinoma in situ of breast.\n2. Receipt of any anti-TIGIT, anti-TGF-β treatment.\n3. Experienced a toxicity that led to permanent discontinuation of prior immunotherapy. All AEs while receiving prior immunotherapy have not completely resolved or resolved to Grade 1 prior to screening, required the use of additional immunosuppression other than corticosteroids.\n4. Unresolved toxicities from prior anticancer therapy, defined as having not resolved to NCI CTCAE v5.0 Grade 0 or 1，or to levels dictated in the inclusion/exclusion criteria, except toxicities not considered a safety risk (e.g., alopecia, neuropathy, or asymptomatic laboratory abnormalities).\n5. Major surgical procedure within 4 weeks prior to the first dose of AK130 or still recovering from prior surgery.\n6. History of organ transplant.\n7. Known allergy or reaction to any component of the AK130 formulation. History of severe hypersensitivity reactions to other mAbs.",
