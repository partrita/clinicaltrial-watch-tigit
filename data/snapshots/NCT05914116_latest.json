Phase 1 adopts an accelerated titration at first dose level followed with classic \"3+3\" design to identify the MTD (maximum tolerated dose) and/or RP2D(Recommended Phase 2 Dose). Phase 2a is a dose expansion phase to confirm the safety, tolerability and explore efficacy in selected malignant solid tumors treated with DB-1311/BNT324 as monotherapy or in combination with novel hormone therapy (NHT) in prostate cancer (PC). And the drug-drug-interaction (DDI) sub-study to evaluate the effect of lopinavir/ritonavir and itraconazole on the PK of DB-1311 and its payload."
