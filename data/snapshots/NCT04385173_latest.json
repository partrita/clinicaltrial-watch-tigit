      "briefSummary": "This is a pilot phase I study to evaluate the safety and efficacy on B7-H3 CAR-T in between Temozolomide cycles in treating patients with glioblastoma that has come back or does not respond to the standard treatment. The antigen B7-H3 is highly expressed in glioblastoma of a subset of patients. B7-H3 CAR-T, made from isolated patient peripheral blood mononuclear cells, can specifically attack patient glioblastoma cells that expressing B7-H3.",
      "detailedDescription": "Background\n\n* B7-H3 is expressed in 70% of patients with glioblastoma\n* B7-H3 is not expressed in normal tissues especially not in central nervous system. Therefore, it is an attractive GBM target for CAR-T therapy\n* The investigators constructed a retroviral vector encoding a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) targeting B7-H3, which can mediate CAR transfer into patient T cells with high efficiency.\n\nObjectives\n\n* To evaluate the safety and tolerability intratumoral/intracerebroventricular injection of B7-H3 CAR-T when used in between Temozolomide cycles\n* To compare the overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) of R/R GBM patients treated with B7-H3 CAR-T in between Temozolomide cycles to the historical Temozolomide data\n* To access the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of B7-H3 CAR-T in between Temozolomide cycles\n\nDesign\n\nPatients autologous T cells are activated and transduced with retrovirus containing B7-H3 CAR. CAR-T cells are expanded ex vivo and infused back to patients via intratumoral or intracerebroventricular injection through an Ommaya catheter. 3 injections of CAR-T are planned at two different doses with 1-2 weeks intervals. The CAR-T injections occur in between Temozolomide (TMZ) cycles. Temozolomide treatment in the cycle of CAR-T injections will be stopped and resumed next cycle. Patients may receive additional CAR-T cycles at the discretion of the principal investigator and oncologist."
