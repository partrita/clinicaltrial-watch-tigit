      "briefSummary": "The Time-based Register and Analysis of COPD Endpoints (TRACE) study is prospective cohort study aiming at evaluating COPD patients using simple basic tools normally used in the clinic at hand of any physician. The objective of the study is to accomplish specific aims. 1) describing the disease variation over time. 2) defining different disease behaviours; and 3) evaluating the impact of different therapeutic approaches on this behaviour in the different patient types. TRACE is a single center non-interventional prospective observational cohort study of COPD patients. Upon identification of cases, patients are followed-up in yearly visits sine die until death or lost to follow-up. Starting in 2012, during the yearly visits clinical, functional, radiological and analytical information is recorded via a standardized questionnaire. Variables recorded were: socio-demographics, tobacco history, comorbidities, clinical presentation during the previous year, exacerbations and hospitalization in the previous year, current pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatments, and complementary tests, including at least chest radiology, pre- and post-bronchodilator spirometry, and analytical results. Endpoints include a variety of clinically relevant variables including disease phenotypic expression, diagnostic measures and therapeutic responses."
