      "briefSummary": "To explore the disease outcome prognosis of cough variant asthma by observing the outcomes of cough variant asthma and the effects of Chinese and Western medicine interventions, and to provide a scientific basis for optimizing the treatment protocol of combined traditional and Western medicine for cough variant asthma. This is a multi-center, non-randomized, prospective cohort study. This study started in March 2022 and is going on now. On an informed consent basis, a cohort of 164 patients with diagnosis of CVA are engaged. All patients will receive 8-week treatment (ICS/LABA plus Chinese herbal medicine for trial group while ICS/LABA only for control group) and be observed in next 24 weeks. Patients will be followed up every 2 weeks during treatment period and every 4 weeks in observation.The feasibility and correctness of the study will be supervised by two supervisors. To ensure that participants adhere to their follow-up plans, we remind them of their fixed visiting by phone or message. Additionally, incentives are used to appreciate participants for their cooperation."
