      "briefSummary": "The goal of this study is to produce a new treatment that would benefit adult subjects by lowering the risk of anaphylactic reactions (desensitization), and changing the peanut-specific immune response in subjects who have peanut allergy (tolerance). This project is designed to study the innovative idea that oral immunotherapy (OIT), the ingestion of small increasing amounts of food allergen, will desensitize subjects with peanut hypersensitivity by regulating their mucosal and systemic immune reactivity and cause long-term tolerance.",
      "detailedDescription": "The goal of this proposal is to produce a new treatment that would benefit subjects who have peanut allergy by lowering the risk of anaphylactic reactions (desensitization), and changing the peanut-specific immune response in subjects who have peanut allergy (tolerance). This is a research study to test stimulation of the immune system to improve peanut allergy. The approach the investigators will use for peanut allergy is called desensitization. A person becomes desensitized to a food by taking small, increasing amounts of the food to help the body become used to the food so that it no longer causes a severe allergic reaction.\n\nThe study also looks at the safety and immune system effects of the investigational study product, peanut protein. The word \"investigational\" means the study product is still being tested in research studies and is not approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).\n\nThis project is designed to study if peanut oral immunotherapy (POIT) will desensitize subjects with peanut hypersensitivity by regulating their oral and systemic immune reactivity and cause long-term tolerance."
