      "briefSummary": "Allergic rhinitis (AR) is induced by an immunoglobulin E (IgE)-mediated reaction in the allergen-sensitized subjects, affecting 10% to 40% of the world population. AR could be divided into two kinds, perennial AR and seasonal AR (SAR).\n\nIn recent years, biologics have become promising drugs for allergic diseases. The efficacy and safety of Omalizumab in treating SAR have been well proven by previous studies. However, the efficacy in preseasonal treatment for SAR has not yet been studied before."
