      "briefSummary": "Researchers are looking for new ways to treat people with extensive-stage small cell lung cancer (SCLC) that has relapsed or is refractory. Gocatamig is a new type of immunotherapy that uses a person's immune system to find and destroy cancer cells. Ifinatamab deruxtecan (also known as I-DXd) is a drug which binds to a specific target on cancer cells and delivers treatment to destroy those cells. Durvalumab is a different type of immunotherapy that also destroys cancer cells. Researchers want to know if giving gocatamig, I-DXd, and gocatamig with I-DXd or durvalumab can treat SCLC that did not respond or stopped responding to a prior treatment.\n\nThe goals of this study are to learn:\n\n* If gocatamig alone, I-DXd alone, and gocatamig with I-DXd or durvalumab are safe and well tolerated\n* If people who receive gocatamig alone, I-DXd alone, and gocatamig with I-DXd or durvalumab have their SCLC get smaller or go away",
      "detailedDescription": "This study will consist of two parts. Part 1 will assess the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of gocatamig and I-DXd at doses determined in study MK-6070-001 (NCT: NCT04471727). Part 2 will assess the safety and tolerability of gocatamig in participants in Japan and China. Part 3 will assess the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of gocatamig with durvalumab."
