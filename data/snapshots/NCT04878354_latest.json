      "briefSummary": "This is a clinical study in children and adolescents (5-17 years) with allergy to pollen from birch (or related trees). It compares the tree SLIT-tablet with placebo in relieving rhinoconjunctivitis symptoms during the birch/tree pollen season based on the average allergic rhinoconjunctivitis daily total combined score.\n\nThe study will also collect health-related quality of life information in the groups treated with the tree SLIT-tablet or with placebo during the pollen season.\n\nThe trial medication used is already approved to treat allergic rhinitis caused by birch/tree pollen in adults in several countries?.",
      "detailedDescription": "This is a phase III, parallel-group, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to evaluate efficacy and safety of the tree SLIT-tablet in children and adolescents (5-17 years) who have rhinoconjunctivitis (with or without asthma) induced by pollen from birch trees or by trees belonging to the birch homologous group. Approximately 1000 children and adolescents will be enrolled in the trial and will receive either the tree SLIT-tablet or placebo.\n\nThe trial consists of 3 periods: a screening period, a treatment period, which includes pre-seasonal and co seasonal treatment, and a follow-up period. The duration is up to 13 months for each participant.\n\nThe trial is conducted in several European countries and in Canada."

Sleep disturbance\n  2. Impairment of daily activities, leisure and/or sport\n  3. Impairment of school or work\n  4. Troublesome symptoms\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* A clinically relevant history of symptomatic seasonal AR/C caused by an allergen source, other than tree pollen from the birch homologous group, with a season overlapping the TPS\n* A clinically relevant history of symptomatic perennial AR/C caused by an allergen source such as animal hair and dander to which the subject is exposed during the TPS\n* Any clinical deterioration of asthma (i.e. asthma exacerbation) that resulted in emergency treatment, hospitalisation or treatment with systemic corticosteroids within 3 months prior to randomisation\n* Reduced lung function at randomisation defined as forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) \\<70% of predicted value. For subjects with asthma, this is assessed on subject's usual asthma medication following at least a 6-hour wash-out of SABA. This criterion does not need to be fulfilled if the subject is \\<7 years old, cannot perform reproducible FEV1 manoeuvres despite coaching and is not considered as having a diagnosis of asthma\n* Ongoing treatment with any allergy immunotherapy product\n* Severe chronic oral inflammation\n* A diagnosis of eosinophilic oesophagitis\n* A relevant history of systemic allergic reaction e.g. anaphylaxis with cardiorespiratory symptoms, generalised urticaria or severe facial angioedema that in the opinion of the investigator may constitute an increased safety concern\n* Immunosuppressive treatment (ATC code L04 or L01) within 3 months prior to the screening visit",
