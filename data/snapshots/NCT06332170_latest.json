      "briefSummary": "HS-20093 is a fully humanized IgG1 antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) which specifically binds to B7-H3, a target wildly expressed on solid tumor cells. The objectives of this study are to investigate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and anti-tumor activity of HS-20093 in combination with other anti-cancer agents in patients with advanced solid tumor patients.",
      "detailedDescription": "This is a phase 1, open-label, multi-center, dose-escalation and expansion, phase 1 study in Chinses subjects with advanced solid tumors. This study is in design allowing assessment of safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and anti-tumor activity of HS-20093 in combination with other anti-cancer agents.\n\nA total of 5 combination-treatments will be carried out in 3 cohorts. The target population of dose escalation part is patients have progressed on or intolerant to available standard therapies, and the dose expansion part will enroll patients who have not received prior treatment for advanced/metastatic disease.\n\nAll patients will be carefully followed for adverse events during the study treatment and for 90 days after the last dose of study drug. Subjects will be permitted to continue therapy with assessments for progression if the product is well tolerated and sustained clinical benefit exists."
