      "briefSummary": "This is single center, open-label phase 1 dose escalation trial that uses modified 3+3 design to identify a recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of CAR.B7-H3 T cell product. An expansion cohort will enroll additional subjects at the RP2D for a total enrollment of up to 21 subjects on the protocol.",
      "detailedDescription": "This study is intended for the patients who have been diagnosed with Epithelial Ovarian Cancer that either came back or did not improve after previous treatments. The purpose of this study is to test the safety of using a new treatment called autologous T lymphocyte chimeric antigen receptor cells against the B7-H3 antigen (CAR.B7-H3 T cells) in patients with ovarian cancer. This treatment has not been approved by the Food and Drug Administration.\n\nThe study investigator's goal is to calculate the Maximum tolerated dose of the CAR.B7-H3 cells There are two parts to this study. In part 1, subject's blood sample will be used to manufacture the CAR.B7-H3 T cells.\n\nOvarian cancer cells carry a substance called B7-H3 which is not found in other healthy cells. the subject's T cells will be modified to make CAR.B7-H3 T cells so they may attack and destroy ovarian cancer cells that carry the B7-H3 substance. The CAR.B7-H3 T cells are given through a catheter in the abdomen, after completing three rounds of lymphodepletion chemotherapy. Lymphodepletion chemotherapy prepares the body to receive the CAR.B7-H3 T cells.\n\nIn part 2 of the study, the subjects will receive the CAR.B7-H3 T cells. Eligible patients will receive lymphodepletion chemotherapy with cyclophosphamide and fludarabine for three consecutive days. If they continue to meet the eligibility criteria, the modified CAR.B7-H3 T cells will be given to them 2-14 days after the last lymphodepletion chemotherapy session. Three infusions of the CAR.B7-H3 T cells may be given to the subject through a catheter in the abdomen. Infusions will be done once a week.\n\nLymphodepletion chemotherapy and infusion of the CAR.B7-H3 T cells will happen at UNC Cancer Hospital. On the days the subjects receive the CAR.B7-H3 T cells infusion- Blood, fluid, and tumor samples will be collected from the subject for research purposes. Tumor biopsies are a mandatory part of this research.\n\nPost infusion visits are - 3, 4, and 6 weeks. Additional visits will happen every 3 months for one year after the last infusion. Similar follow-up clinic visits will be completed annually, for a total of 5 years.\n\nThis is a research study to obtain new information that may help people in the future."

Subject has a known additional malignancy that is active and/or progressive and requiring treatment; exceptions include basal cell or squamous cell skin cancer, in situ cervical or bladder cancer, or other cancer for which the subject has been disease-free for at least five years.\n11. Current use of systemic corticosteroids at doses ≥10 mg prednisone daily or it's equivalent; those receiving \\<10 mg daily may be enrolled at the discretion of the investigator.\n12. Subject has active infection with HIV, HTLV, HBV, and HCV (tests can be pending at the time of cell procurement; only those samples confirming lack of active infection will be used to generate transduced cells).
