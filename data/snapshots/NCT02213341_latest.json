The investigators will do this by studying the immune cells and allergy responses in the blood prior to and after receipt of the third DTaP vaccine.",
      "detailedDescription": "This is a single-site study of infants who are scheduled to receive their third series (\\~6 month) vaccinations, as routine care, to investigate whether the diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis (DTaP) vaccination has an effect on specific immunoglobulin E (IgE) levels to milk, egg, or peanut. Infants will be assigned to one of two groups depending on the infant's sensitization to milk, egg, and peanut."
