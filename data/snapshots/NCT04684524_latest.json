The CT scan LMK staging system represents the most widely established method of sinus CT scoring. The LMK total score is based on assessment of the CT scan findings for each sinus area (maxillary, anterior ethmoid, posterior ethmoid, sphenoid, and frontal sinus plus the osteomeatal complex on each side). The extent of sinus opacification is rated on a 3-point scale ranging from 0 = normal to 2 = total opacification. In addition, the osteomeatal complex is graded as 0 = not occluded or 2 = occluded. The maximum score is 12 per side; total score ranges from 0 (normal) to 24 (more opacified) corresponding to the sum of all sinuses and the osteomeatal complexes bilaterally. Higher score indicate worse outcome; a negative change from baseline indicate improvement. Baseline was defined as the last available value before the first dose of study drug.",

Each smell has a possible of 4 answers with one being correct, therefore the potential total scores can range from 0 (worst possible score) to 40 (best possible score), with 1 point being awarded for each correctly identified odor. Scores of \\<=18 were classified as anosmia, 19 to 25 as severe microsmia, 26 to 30 as moderate microsmia, 31 to 34 as mild microsmia, and 35 to 40 as normal smell appreciation.

It is a recommended scale to determine the participant's disease severity and to guide the treatment for CRS. The participant is asked to answer the following question: \"How troublesome are your symptoms of your rhinosinusitis\" on a 10-centimeter VAS from 0 = not troublesome to 10 = worst thinkable troublesome. Based on their score on the VAS, the severity of rhinosinusitis is divided into 3 categories as follows: mild = VAS 0 to 3, moderate = VAS \\>3 to 7 and severe = VAS \\>7 to 10; higher score indicating worse outcome; a negative change from baseline indicate improvement.

Above each odorant strip is a multiple-choice question with 4 alternative words to describe the odor and the participant is asked to indicate which word best describes the odor. Each smell has a possible of 4 answers with one being correct, therefore the potential total scores can range from 0 (worst possible score) to 40 (best possible score), with 1 point being awarded for each correctly identified odor. Scores of \\<=18 were classified as anosmia, 19 to 25 as severe microsmia, 26 to 30 as moderate microsmia, 31 to 34 as mild microsmia, and 35 to 40 as normal smell appreciation.
