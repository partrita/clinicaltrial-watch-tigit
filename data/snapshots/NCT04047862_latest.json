A serious adverse event (SAE) was any untoward medical occurrence that, at any dose, resulted in death, was life-threatening, required hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, resulted in disability, was a congenital anomaly or was considered a medically significant. Treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAE) was an AE that has an onset date or a worsening in severity from baseline on or after the first dose of study drug up to 30 days following study drug discontinuation or initiation of the first new systemic anticancer therapy, whichever occurred first. Severity of AEs was assessed according to National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI-CTCAE) v.5.0, which consists of: Grade 1 Mild; Grade 2 Moderate; Grade 3: Severe; Grade 4: Life-threatening; Grade 5: Death due to AE.",

Treatment-induced ADA was defined as ADA-evaluable participants that were ADA-negative at baseline and ADA-positive after drug administration during the treatment or follow-up observation period. Treatment-boosted ADA was defined as the Baseline-positive ADA-evaluable participants with significant increases (4-fold or higher) in ADA titer after drug administration during the treatment or follow-up observation period. NAb positive was defined as ADA-evaluable participants with positive Nab at any time including baseline and/or after drug administration.",

Any pathological lymph nodes (whether target or non-target) must have reduction in short axis to \\< 10 mm.
