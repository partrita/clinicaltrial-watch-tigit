Atopic dermatitis, also referred to as eczema, is a condition that causes the skin to become itchy, dry, and cracked.\n\nFrom the previous studies on the study drug, it is seen that the study drug has an acceptable safety and effectiveness in participants with atopic dermatitis.\n\nThe aim of this study is to get additional information on the safety and effectiveness of the study drug, particularly the information on aspects of atopic dermatitis in skin of color participants.\n\nThe study is looking at several other research questions, including:\n\n* What side effects may happen from taking the study drug\n* How much study drug is in your blood at different times\n* How much the study drug improves quality of life and mental health"
