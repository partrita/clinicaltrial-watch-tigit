      "briefSummary": "Atopic Dermatitis (AD), also known as eczema, is a skin disease that causes the skin to be hot, dry and scaly, and have severe itching. There are different kinds of eczema. Eczema herpeticum (EH) is a type of eczema that spreads due to an underlying herpes virus infection. The purpose of this research study is to identify the risk factors that may cause EH.",
      "detailedDescription": "AD is characterized by chronic skin inflammation and infections. It is hypothesized that AD is caused by irritants in the environment and that symptoms of EH become worse with stress and changes in hormone levels. This study will examine skin cells collected from study participants to determine the risk factors for EH that are present in people with AD who develop EH.\n\nThis study will examine dendritic cells (DC) from the skin and blood of study participants to determine the differences between DCs of study participants. This study will recruit four types of participants:\n\n* Group 1 will include participants with AD, EH, and recurrent herpes simplex virus (HSV)\n* Group 2 will include participants with AD and recurring HSV infections but without EH\n* Group 3 will include participants with AD but without EH or HSV infection\n* Group 4 will include participants in good general health without AD, EH, or HSV infection\n\nAt the single study visit, skin and blood collection will occur."
