      "detailedDescription": "Luminex-based peptide assay (LPA) is a novel tool using machine learning techniques, developed to predict different degrees of food allergy has been successfully reported among cow's milk protein allergy. This technique provide a more precise and advanced adaptation from microarray-based immunoassay (MIA). Using this technique will aid us for the differentiation of clinical phenotypes of wheat-allergic patients. This study will be the first study to date using this technique aim to determine major IgE-binding epitope among immediated-reaction of wheat allergic children to differentiate clinical phenotypes, and may lead to further study to develop the new therapeutic approach to wheat-allergic patients."
