      "briefSummary": "Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a chronic inflammatory skin disease associated with pruritus. Methotrexate can be used to treat refractory disease to conventional therapy.\n\nIt will be conducted a single arm trial with twelve adult patients with moderate to severe AD on methotrexate for 24 weeks.\n\nInvestigators intend to evaluate the effect methotrexate on cytokines and chemokines involved in the inflammatory response, on IgE levels, on pruritus, and on EASI and SCORAD severity scores.",
      "detailedDescription": "Introduction: Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a chronic inflammatory skin disease associated with pruritus. Methotrexate (MTX) can be used to treat refractory disease to conventional therapy, but there are few studies showing its effect on the profile of cytokines involved in the inflammatory response.\n\nObjectives: To assess the effect of MTX on the cytokines involved in the inflammatory response of adult AD patients treated with methotrexate for 24 weeks. As specific objectives, investigators intend to assess the evolution of serum IgE levels, the EASI (Eczema Area and Severity Index) and SCORAD (Scoring Atopic Dermatitis) severity scores and pruritus in them.\n\nMethods: It will be conducted an open, prospective study with twelve adult patients with moderate to severe AD on MTX for 24 weeks. Each participant is expected to attend 7 visits during 6 months of follow-up. In clinical healthy and injured skin, two assessments will be performed: 1) mRNA expression of IL-4, IL-10, IL-17A, IL-22, IL-31, oncostatin M receptor (OSMR), alpha subunit IL-31 (IL-31RA) receptor, TNF-α, IFN-γ, TSLP, TARC and MDC by Real Time-PCR at the initial week and week 24; 2) expression of IL-31, IL-31RA, OSMR, TSLP and Ki67 by immunohistochemistry at the initial week and week 24.\n\nSkin samples from non-atopic subjects will be utilized as controls for the assays, paired by gender and age.\n\nAdditional analysis of serum levels of IgE (nephelometric method) at the initial week and week 24 of the study will be performed.\n\nAD severity scores (EASI and SCORAD) will be tested and pruritus will be analyzed by a visual analog scale at the initial, week 12 and week 24."
