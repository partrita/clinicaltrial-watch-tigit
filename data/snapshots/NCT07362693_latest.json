Acute exacerbation of asthma is defined as the sudden onset of wheezing, shortness of breath, cough, chest tightness and other symptoms beyond the definition of uncontrolled asthma, or the aggravation of the original symptoms, and is characterized by decreased expiratory flow, often induced by exposure to allergens, irritants or respiratory tract infection.\n4. Blood eosinophil count ≥150 cells /μL.\n5. Age ≥ 18 years old.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n1. The underlying diseases were chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and bronchiectasis;\n2. Known allergic history to biological agents;\n3. Human immunodeficiency virus infection, active pulmonary tuberculosis or pulmonary malignant tumor;\n4. Complicated with other diseases requiring long-term systemic use of glucocorticoids or immunosuppressants (such as autoimmune diseases);\n5. Pregnant or lactating women;\n6.
