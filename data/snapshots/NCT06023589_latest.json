Screening/Run-in period of 4 to 6 weeks,\n2. 52-week double-blind Treatment period,\n3. Post-treatment Follow-up period of 12 weeks.\n\nParticipants will be randomised 2:1 to receive either tezepelumab or placebo administered by (SC) Subcutaneous injections for 52 weeks (double-blind Treatment period).\n\nThere will then be a 12-week off-treatment Follow-up period for participants who do not continue in the optional open-label Active Treatment Extension period.\n\nAn optional open-label Active Treatment Extension will allow all eligible participants the opportunity to receive active treatment with tezepelumab. The Active Treatment Extension period of the study will start following the 52-week double-blind Treatment period and will consist of a 104-week open-label Treatment period prior to the 12-week post-treatment Follow-up period."
