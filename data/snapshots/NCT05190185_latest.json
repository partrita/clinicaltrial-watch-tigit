      "briefSummary": "B7-H3 (also known as CD276) is widely expressed on the surface of a variety of malignancies solid tumors, while it rarely or even doesn't express on normal tissues. Therefore, B7-H3 is an ideal target for chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells therapy. TAA06 injection is a CAR T injection targeting B7-H3. This is a phase I clinical study with the primary objective of evaluating the safety and tolerability of TAA06 injection in subjects with TAA06-positive advanced solid tumors. The secondary objectives are as follows: to evaluate the distribution, proliferation and persistence of B7-H3-targeted CAR T cells after injection of TAA06 in subjects; to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of TAA06 injection in subjects with TAA06-positive advanced solid tumor."
