      "briefSummary": "Wheat allergy is increasing in Thailand. Some studies show that cutaneous exposure of allergen may cause allergy and there are many wheat containing skin care products that are over-the-counter. So the purpose of our study is to determine level of specific immunoglobulin E antibodies to wheat and omega-5 gliadin in wheat allergy patients after stop using wheat containing skin care products.",
      "detailedDescription": "All children in this study were sensitized to wheat. Each patient was clinically evaluated, with focus on wheat allergy by medical history, medical examination included skin status (suspected atopic dermatitis or not). Blood sample was taken for baseline determination of immunoglobulin E antibodies to wheat and to omega-5 gliadin. Transepidermal water loss was examined in case with atopic dermatitis. The primary outcome was the specific immunoglobulin E antibodies to wheat and omega-5 gliadin in case that stop using wheat containing skin care product and case that continue using products."
