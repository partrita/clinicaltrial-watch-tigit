      "briefSummary": "Allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA) is a immunological pulmonary disorder caused by hypersensitive reaction to spores of Aspergillus fumigatus. The prevalence of disease is about 1-2% in asthmatics and 2-15% in patients with cystic fibrosis. The interest in ABPA stems from the fact that the disease is glucocorticoid-sensitive and early treatment can prevent progression to end-stage lung disease. Recently anti-Th2 therapies have been suggested as treatment for ABPA. Vitamin D has been shown to suppress the Th2 responses and decrease the levels of Th2 interleukins. Hence, the investigators propose to assess the role of vitamin D in treating ABPA.",
      "detailedDescription": "Allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA) is a immunological pulmonary disorder caused by hypersensitive reaction to spores of Aspergillus fumigatus. The prevalence of disease is about 1-2% in asthmatics and 2-15% in patients with cystic fibrosis. The interest in ABPA stems from the fact that the disease is glucocorticoid-sensitive and early treatment can prevent progression to end-stage lung disease.\n\nSystemic steroids remain the mainstay of treatment in ABPA. Antifungal agents are also useful as they reduce fungal load. Newer therapies like omalizumab (anti immunoglobulin E \\[IgE\\] antibody), inhalational amphotericin and Anti Th2 therapies are being studied.\n\nIn pathogenesis of ABPA, there is heightened Th2 activity as a result of type 1 hypersensitive reaction to Aspergillus fumigatus and levels of Th2 cytokines like IL-3, IL-5 and IL-13 and IgE levels are increased in patients with ABPA compared with asthma patients without ABPA.\n\nRecently anti Th2 therapies have been suggested as treatment for ABPA. Vitamin D has been shown to suppress the Th2 immunity and decrease the levels of Th2 interleukins. Hence, the investigators propose to assess the role of vitamin D in treatment of ABPA."
