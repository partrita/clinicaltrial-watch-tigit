Human Cancers,"Therapeutic antibodies have significantly improved the prognosis of patients with a range of cancers. Currently available therapeutic antibodies belong to the IgG class. This study is looking at a new drug called MOv18 IgE which belongs to a different class of antibody, the IgE class. IgE antibodies may trigger a more powerful immune response to tumour cells than these available IgG antibodies and so be more effective in treating certain types of cancer. This is the first time an IgE antibody therapy will be given to patients with cancer.

The MOv18 IgE antibody is designed to recognise and attach to FRa. Scientists have found more of this protein on the surface of certain cancer cells than on the surface of normal cells, most commonly ovarian cancer but also cancers of the kidney, endometrium, lung, breast, bladder, colon and pancreas. Once attached, the MOv18 IgE antibody should trigger the body's own immune system to attack and kill the cancer cells.

Patients will be selected based on the presence of FRa on their tumour in a previous biopsy. The study is the first study of this new antibody treatment to be given to humans and will focus primarily on the assessment of safety confirming the findings of preclinical studies that exposure to MOv18 IgE will not trigger anaphylaxis. This is in addition to extensive pharmacokinetic (PK), biodistribution of the antibody and immunological response. The study will follow a dose escalation design where small groups of patients are treated at a set dose, starting with a very low dose followed by exponential increasing doses, to find a safe dose at which the drug has a good chance of effectively treating the cancer. Patients will receive a short course of treatment. Patients treated at the higher dose levels will be asked to provide a pre and post treatment biopsy to explore the effect of the treatment on the tumour.",26,NCT02546921,2026-02-05,2022-07-15,No Change,Phase I Study of MOv18 IgE,PHASE1,Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) and Non-serious Adverse Events (AEs) Considered to be at Least Possibly Related to MOv18 IgE,Cancer Research UK,COMPLETED,2021-07-30,2016-02-16,IgE
"Advanced Ovarian Cancer, Platinum-resistant Ovarian Cancer","EPS101-10-02 is a two-part, Phase Ib, open-label, dose escalation and expansion trial in patients with platinum resistant ovarian cancer whose disease has progressed after no more than 4 lines of standard therapy.

In total, the trial will enrol approximately 45 patients. All enrolled patients will have biopsy accessible, measurable disease with a confirmed FRα expression of 5% or higher.

MOv18 IgE will be administered to approximately 30 patients in Part 1 and up to a further 15 in Part 2.

Patients will receive treatment on Days 1, 8 and 15 of a 21-day cycle and may continue treatment until radiological disease progression or unacceptable toxicity despite optimal medical management or dose or schedule modification, or withdrawal of consent.

The starting dose of MOv18 IgE is 3 mg.

Patient screening will occur during the 28 days prior to the first administration of MOv18 IgE. All patients will undergo PK, PD and safety assessments, as well as disease response (tumour) assessments to determine the potential clinical benefit of MOv18 IgE. In all instances, patients will be followed up for overall survival (OS) for a maximum of 270 days after their last dose of trial treatment, or until withdrawal of consent, lost to follow-up, death, or the overall end of trial, whichever is earliest.

In Part 1, MOv18 IgE will be administered at increasing dose levels in different patient cohorts of approximately 6 patients, until selection of the Part 2 dose. The dose of MOv18 IgE administered in Part 1 will be escalated following a Bayesian logistic regression model - Escalation with overdose control (BLRM-EWOC) trial design.

After determination of the Part 2 dose, up to 15 additional patients will be enrolled and treated with MOv18 IgE at that dose to further assess anti-tumour activity of MOv18 IgE and obtain additional information on its safety, PK and PD.",45,NCT06547840,2026-02-05,2025-06-18,No Change,A Study of MOv18 IgE in Folate Receptor Alpha-expressing Platinum Resistant Ovarian Cancer,PHASE1,Part 1: To evaluate the safety and tolerability of MOv18 IgE,Epsilogen Ltd,RECRUITING,2027-03,2024-09-03,IgE
Allergy,"The intranasal challenge study will be performed over 8 weeks outside of the birch pollen season (November to January) as a randomized, double blind and placebo-controlled study. During a screening visit, 15 individuals will be recruited according to eligibility criteria. They will be randomized into 3 groups (i.n. administration of anti-IgE antibodies, Bet v 1 or placebo). Intranasal administration will take place on three consecutive days and serum samples will be taken 3, 5, and 8 weeks (+/- 4 days) after the treatment for analysis of total and specific IgE levels",15,NCT03019237,2026-02-05,2017-01-10,No Change,Effect of Intranasal Anti-IgE Antibodies on IgE Production,NA,change of allergen-specific IgE,Medical University of Vienna,COMPLETED,2013-05,2012-11,IgE
