"Head and Neck Neoplasms, MSI-H Cancer, Melanoma","Rationale:

Tumor immunotherapy has demonstrated that therapies focused on enhancing T cell responses against cancer can result in a significant survival benefit in subjects with advanced stages of cancer. The most frequently used immunotherapy drugs bind to the Programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) or programmed death protein 1 (PD-1). This binding interrupts the PD-L1/PD-1 pathway which inhibits an anti-tumor response of the immune system. Not all patients respond to anti-PD-1 or anti-PD-L1 treatment and therefore, combinations of immunotherapy drugs have been investigated and proven more effective than single-agent immunotherapy. These combinations, however, also increase the chance of immune toxicity. Possible strategies to overcome this problem are to develop less toxic combinations of immunotherapy drugs.

The T-cell immunoreceptor with immunoglobulin and ITIM domain (TIGIT) protein is also a target for immunotherapy. TIGIT is overexpressed in several malignancies including, melanoma, head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), and microsatellite instability high (MSI-H) colorectal cancer. The combination of the anti-TIGIT drug tiragolumab with the anti-PD-L1 drug atezolizumab increased the overall response rate by 15.1% compared to atezolizumab alone in a study with non-small cell lung cancer patients (NSCLC), without increasing toxicity.

In this trial, we will assess anti-tumor activity, safety, and tolerability of atezolizumab in combination with tiragolumab in subjects with cancer. We will also investigate proteins in the tumor to determine if we can predict which patients will respond to the atezolizumab and tiragolumab treatment. Patients will be included in one of four cohorts, namely: cohort 1, patients with localized HNSCC who will be treated with atezolizumab and tiragolumab followed by tumor resection, cohort 2, patients with metastatic MSI-H tumors, cohort 3, patients with irresectable or metastatic melanoma who progressed after PD-1 treatment, or cohort 4, with patients with a locally advanced or metastatic solid tumor for whom, based on available clinical data, treatment with anti-PD-L1 immunotherapy may be beneficial. Acquired data could lead to improved, more patient-tailored immune checkpoint inhibition.

Objective:

The main objective of the trial is to determine the pathological response rate in cohort 1 and the radiological response rates in cohort 2, 3 and 4. The secondary objectives of the trial are the safety of atezolizumab and tiragolumab, the response rates measured by overall response rate, disease free survival rate, duration of response and the last secondary objective is to determine the correlation between the protein expression of different proteins involved in the immune response of cancer to immunotherapy and the different response rates as mentioned before.

Main trial endpoints:

Pathologic response of the primary tumor in patients with HNSCC and objective response rate according to RECIST 1.1 and iRECIST in patients with advanced or metastatic MSI-H cancer, metastatic melanoma, and patients with a locally advanced or metastatic solid tumor whom, in the opinion of the investigator, based on available clinical data, may benefit from treatment with anti-PD-L1 immunotherapy.

Secondary trial endpoints:

The secondary endpoints are toxicity scored according to the common criteria for adverse events version 5.0, disease free survival in patients with HNSCC, overall response rate, progression free survival and duration of response in the patients in cohort 2, 3 and 4 as well as The correlation between the expression of the proteins TIGIT, PD-1, PD-L1 and CD8 on tumor tissue and pathologic and radiographic response rate.

Trial design:

Open label phase 2 basket trial with atezolizumab and tiragolumab in patients with localized HNSCC who will undergo surgery, and advanced or metastatic MSI-H cancer, PD-1 resistant metastatic melanoma, and patients with a locally advanced or metastatic solid tumor who, in the opinion of the investigator, based on available clinical data, may benefit from treatment with anti-PD-L1 and anti-TIGIT immunotherapy.

Trial population:

Subjects with localized HNSCC who will undergo surgery, and advanced or metastatic MSI-H cancer, PD-1 resistant metastatic melanoma, and patients with a locally advanced or metastatic solid tumor who, in the opinion of the investigator, based on available clinical data, may benefit from treatment with anti-PD-L1 and anti-TIGIT immunotherapy.

Interventions:

Subjects will receive atezolizumab and tiragolumab every 3-weeks until 1) resection as scheduled for HNSCC after 2 courses, 2) resectable disease for the MSI-H tumors, 3) progressive disease or side effects requiring treatment termination or 4) a maximum of 2 years. At baseline archival tissue or a tumor biopsy will be obtained and tissue will be collected once during the trial and when lesions are surgically resected. Blood samples will be collected during the trial to measure circulating tumor DNA. During the trial regular CT or MRI scans will be made to monitor the response to the treatment.",97,NCT05483400,2026-02-05,2025-03-28,No Change,Open Label Phase 2 Basket Trial With Atezolizumab and Tiragolumab in Solid Tumors,PHASE2,Pathologic response in cohort 1,University Medical Center Groningen,RECRUITING,2027-09,2023-10-18,TIGIT

"Conjunctivitis, Allergic","Allergic conjunctivitis is a prevalent ocular condition affecting approximately 10-20% of the global population, with 40-60% of allergic individuals exhibiting ocular symptoms. It is characterized by redness, itching, burning, and tearing, which result from excessive activation of immune response cells. Severe forms can significantly impact vision and quality of life, particularly in children, adolescents, and young adults. The disease is mediated by hypersensitivity reactions: Th2 lymphocytes release cytokines (IL-4, IL-5, IL-13) that stimulate IgE production by B lymphocytes. IgE binds to mast cells and induces the release of pro-inflammatory mediators upon allergen recognition. Regulatory T cells (Tregs) play a critical role in maintaining immune homeostasis by suppressing the activation and proliferation of effector T cell subsets, including Th1, Th2, Th9, and Th17, via cell-surface molecules such as TIGIT, LAP-TGF-β, and PD-1. Additionally, Tregs produce IL-10, which suppresses IgE production and induces IgG4 secretion by B cells. Allergen-specific immunotherapy (desensitization) has been employed to reduce symptoms and prevent recurrence in allergic diseases.

Rationale:

Allergic conjunctivitis is a public health concern that affects the quality of life of a substantial portion of the Mexican population. Immunological imbalances between effector T cells and Tregs have been reported. Understanding the balance of these subpopulations and the role of TIGIT and PD-1 molecules in Treg functional status is critical to elucidating disease mechanisms. Moreover, it is important to determine whether desensitization therapy induces changes in the Th2/Treg ratio and modulates TIGIT and PD-1 expression, which could serve as biomarkers of treatment response or therapeutic targets.

Hypothesis:

The effector function and expression of TIGIT and PD-1 on Tregs are decreased in patients with allergic conjunctivitis and are enhanced following desensitization therapy.

Objectives:

The primary objective is to evaluate the effector function and expression of TIGIT and PD-1 on Tregs and the Th2/Treg ratio in patients with allergic conjunctivitis with and without desensitization therapy, compared to healthy controls. Secondary objectives include assessing correlations between immunological parameters and clinical severity of ocular symptoms and response to treatment.

Study Design and Methods:

This observational, cross-sectional, case-control study will include patients with allergic conjunctivitis, with or without desensitization therapy, and healthy control subjects. Peripheral blood and tear samples will be collected once at enrollment. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells will undergo immunophenotyping to quantify Treg and Th2 populations and assess TIGIT and PD-1 expression. Tregs will be isolated for functional assays. Cytokine concentrations associated with Th2 and Treg cells, as well as IgE and IgG4 levels, will be measured in serum and tears.

Statistical Analysis:

Descriptive statistics will summarize participant characteristics and study outcomes. The Shapiro-Wilk test will assess data distribution. Comparisons between two groups will use t-tests (parametric or non-parametric), and comparisons among more than two groups will use ANOVA (parametric or non-parametric). Correlation analyses will evaluate associations between immunological parameters and clinical outcomes.

Chronic Myeloid Leukemia,"Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is also known as chronic myelogenous leukemia. It's a type of cancer that starts in certain blood-forming cells of the bone marrow.

In CML, a genetic change takes place in an early (immature) version of myeloid cells that make red blood cells, platelets, and most types of white blood cells (except lymphocytes). This change forms an abnormal gene called BCR-ABL, which turns the cell into a CML cell. The leukemia cells grow and divide, building up in the bone marrow and spilling over into the blood. In time, the cells can also settle in other parts of the body, including the spleen. CML is a fairly slow growing leukemia, but it can change into a fast-growing acute leukemia that's hard to treat.

CML occurs mostly in adults, but very rarely it occurs in children, too. In general, their treatment is the same as for adults.

Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is characterized by the expression of the BCR/ABL1 fusion gene and the presence of the Philadelphia chromosome (Ph). The product of this fusion gene is a protein with deregulated tyrosine kinase activity, resulting in a malignant clonal disorder of the hematopoietic stem cells in the bone marrow (BM) and the accumulation of immature myeloid cells in peripheral blood (PB).

The use of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) leads to a complete remission rate reaching 83%; however, mutation in the ABL kinase domain results in certain treatment failure. Furthermore, long-lasting side effects of treatment and the cost of TKIs remain a problem Therefore, the development of new TKI agents and combination therapies is urgently needed for CML patients .

Natural killer (NK) cells serve an important role in eliminating malignant cells. The cytotoxic effects of NK cells were first identified against leukemia cells, and it is now hypothesized that they may have a critical role in leukemia therapy.

The cellular functions of NK cells are mediated by their cell surface receptors, which recognize ligands on cancer cells. The role of NK cells is specifically regulated by the activating or inhibitory killer cell immunoglobulin like receptors (KIRs) on their surface, which bind to the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class I ligands present on the target cells.

There is an abundance of evidence that NK cells can exhibit potent antitumor activity against CML, However, disease-associated mechanisms often inhibit the proper functions of endogenous NK cells, leading to inadequate tumor control and risk for disease progression.

As it is well known, the function of NK cells is precisely regulated by inhibitory and activating receptors.

Recently, T cell immunoreceptor with immunoglobulin and immunoreceptor tyrosine -based inhibitory motif (ITIM domain) (TIGIT) has been identified as a novel NK inhibitory receptor that can lead to NK cell exhaustion and dysfunction.

Targeting TIGIT is believed to restore 4 key function :Restoration of NK function, Depletion of T reg, Increase antigen-specific CD8 memory response and Induction of new antigen-specific CD8 T cells.

TIGIT was first identified as an inhibitory receptor expressed by activated CD4 Tcells , tregs and NK cells.

Pre-Eclampsia,"T lymphocytes, as well as their regulatory subpopulations could possibly possess a part in PE . The changes in T cell subsets that may be seen in preeclampsia include low Treg activity, a shift toward Th1 responses, and the presence Th17 lymphocytes. B cells can participate in the pathophysiology of preeclampsia by producing autoantibodies against adrenoreceptors and autoantibodies that bind the AT1-R (angiotensin II type I receptor)

TH17 cells are a distinctive lineage of TCD4+ cells, which are distinguished by producing a number of effective molecules such as IL-17, which is the most important cytokine produced by these cells . IL-17 is capable of inducing the production of several cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) and IL-1β which possess significant parts in PE pathophysiology .

Regulatory T lymphocytes CD4+ CD25bright are known to play an important role in the development and maintenance of tolerance in peripheral tissues . They express high level of CD25 (IL-2Ra) as well as cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen 4 (CTLA4) and the transcription factor Foxp3 .

It was proposed that regulatory T cells (Tregs) are responsible for mediating maternal tolerance for the fetus and their counts were found to be higher in normal pregnancies However, the role of T reg cells in the development of preeclampsia remains controversial, being decreased in some studies .) and of comparable frequencies to normal pregnancy in others (Hu et, 2008). Tregs suppress maternal immune cells through the secretion of inhibitory cytokines, such as interleukin (IL)-10 and transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β) .

systemic endothelial dysfunction, such as disturbed coagulation function, could be intensified through immune activation, resulting in inflammation and the disturbance of regulatory T (Treg) and Th17 cell balance, and contributing to further activation of the maternal immune responses .

Co-inhibitory-receptors such as CTLA-4 (cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein , LAG-3 (lymphocyte activation gene 3; or CD223), TIM-3 (T-cell immunoglobulin and mucin domain-containing 3), PD-1 (PDCD1; programmed cell death 1), and TIGIT (T-cell immunoreceptor with Ig and ITIM domains) are key factors in maintaining immune homeostasis and play a central role in regulating autoimmune diseases .

These receptors regulate T-cell responses by inhibiting effector T-cell activation directly by promoting the suppressive function of regulatory T-cells (Tregs) and affecting antigen presentation. These cell surface molecules are expressed on activated immune cells (T-cells, B cells, natural killer \[NK\] cells, some myeloid cells) that regulate the inflammatory and autoimmune responses through a negative feedback mechanism. Malfunction of their crucial role or decreased receptor levels can lead to excessive immune activation and autoimmunity .

While augmented effector T-cell activation plays a major role in preeclampsia pathogenesis, insufficient co-inhibitory signals might promote preeclampsia development and progression. Some studies have also shown that multiple co-inhibitory-molecules, e.g., TIM-3, LAG-3, and TIGIT, predominantly regulate the effector T-cell responses within the tissue where their responses are executed . Based on the previous findings on the important role of the co-inhibitory molecules in regulating autoimmunity and cancer immunity, it might be assumed that they also play a role in preeclampsia development and/or progression.",82,NCT05294952,2026-02-05,2024-02-01,No Change,co Ihibtory Receptor in Preeclampsia,PHASE4,early detection of preeclampsia,Assiut University,NOT_YET_RECRUITING,2025-11-04,2025-01-01,TIGIT

"Previously Treated, Advanced, Malignancies","OVERVIEW This is a Phase 1, multi-center, open-label, dose-escalation study of TAB006 in combination with toripalimab. TAB006 is a recombinant humanized, IgG4κ (immunoglobulin gamma 4, kappa) monoclonal antibody (mAb) that specifically binds to the T cell immunoreceptor with Ig and ITIM domains (TIGIT). Toripalimab is a human IgG4κ mAb that specifically binds to the programmed death 1 (PD-1). It is estimated that up to 208 subjects with advanced solid malignancies, including lymphoma will be enrolled in the study.

Subjects must have a histologically or cytologically confirmed advanced solid tumor, including lymphoma.

The study has 3 parts; Part A dose-escalation, Part B cohort expansion, Indication dose expansion.

Dose-Escalation Phase:

Patients who have experienced disease progression will be sequentially enrolled into 5 proposed dose cohorts in Part A and Part B (e.g., Part A Cohort 1, Part A Cohort 2, Part B Cohort 1, Part A Cohort 3, Part B Cohort 2). In Parts A and B, TAB006 is administered as an intravenous infusion (IV) over 60 minutes on Day 1 of each 21-day cycle. In Part B, TAB006 is administered first, then toripalimab is administered IV over 60 minutes for the first dose. If tolerated, subsequent doses of TAB006 and toripalimab will be administered over a minimum of 30 minutes and no longer than 4 hours, if clinically indicated .

Part A is closed to enrollment. Enrollment will begin with Part B, starting at the TAB006 60 mg dose level.

The DLT evaluation period is defined as 21 days following the first dose and inclusive of any dose delays \> 14 days between initiation of the first and second cycle (i.e., if the second cycle is not initiated on day 22). A patient is considered to be ""DLT evaluable"" if they received both TAB006 and toripalimab and complete all evaluations in the DLT evaluation period or are withdrawn within 21 days due to an AE meeting the definition of a DLT.

If that patient does not experience a Grade 2 drug-related AE during the DLT evaluation period, enrollment in the next cohort will proceed. If that patient experiences a Grade 2 drug-related AE, that dose cohort and all subsequent cohorts will revert to a 3+3 design.

* If 0 of the first 3 patients in a dose cohort experience a DLT during the DLT evaluation period, dose escalation may proceed to the next higher dose cohort with approval of the safety monitoring committee (SMC).
* If 1 of the 3 patients in a dose cohort experiences a DLT during the DLT evaluation period, that dose cohort will be expanded to at least 6 patients.
* If no more than 1 of 6 patients in the dose cohort experiences a DLT, dose escalation may proceed to the next planned dose cohort with the approval of the SMC.
* If 2 or more patients in a dose cohort experience a DLT during the DLT evaluation period, the MTD will have been exceeded, and no further patients will be enrolled into that dose cohort or higher dose cohorts.

The protocol may be amended, based on the recommendation of the SMC, to enroll additional patients in a previously tested lower-dose cohort or to add an intermediate-dose cohort.

Patients will be treated until unacceptable toxicity, disease progression per RECIST v1.1 or 2014 Lugano for lymphoma, withdrawal of consent, removal of the patient from study based on investigator's judgment of unacceptable risks to the patient, study termination by the Sponsor, or the completion of a total of 35 cycles (approximately 105 weeks) of study drug treatment.

Treatment beyond RECIST-defined progression \[i.e., immune unconfirmed progression (iUPD) per iRECIST\] is permitted only if the patient provides consent per IRB policy and, in the judgment of the investigator, the patient is clinically stable, defined as:

* No signs or symptoms indicating clinically significant progression of disease;
* No decline in Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status; and Absence of symptomatic rapid disease progression requiring urgent medical intervention (e.g., symptomatic pleural effusion, spinal cord compression).

Patients who are treated beyond RECIST-defined progression may continue treatment until evidence of immune confirmed progression (iCPD) per iRECIST, unacceptable toxicity, withdrawal of consent, removal of the patient from study based on investigator's judgment of unacceptable risks, study termination by the Sponsor, or the completion of a total of 35 cycles (approximately 105 weeks) of study drug treatment.

Dose expansion phase:

There will be 9-24 patients in dose expansion phase (9 to 12 patients each in 1-2 selected dose cohorts in Part B \[TAB006 followed by toripalimab 240 mg Q3W\] to further evaluate safety, PK and preliminary evidence of anti-tumor activity to support the selection of RP2D of TAB006 alone or in combination with toripalimab.

Indication-specific Expansion Phase Up to four primary cancers will be identified for further study in the indication-specific expansion phase. Each indication-specific cohort will enroll approximately 40 patients with disease progression after at least one prior line of standard treatment or for whom there is no standard treatment. All patients will receive TAB006 at the RP2D in combination with toripalimab 240 mg Q3W in 21-day cycles.

Tumor response will be evaluated using the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST v1.1), the immune-related Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (irRECIST), or the New Response Evaluation Criteria in Lymphoma (RECIL) 2017.

DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION TAB006 doses are 18mg, 60mg, 180mg, 600mg and 1800mg. Toripalimab dose is 240mg. TAB006 alone or TAB006 plus toripalimab will be administered as a 60-minute i.v. infusion for the first dose and may be decreased at the investigators discretion to 30 minutes in subsequent infusions.

SAFETY EVALUATIONS Assessment of safety will be determined by vital sign measurements, clinical laboratory tests, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status evaluations, diagnostic imaging, physical examinations, electrocardiograms, and the incidence and severity of adverse events.

Safety will also include evaluations of immune safety and immunogenicity. EFFICACY EVALUATIONS will include best overall response, objective response rate, duration of response or duration of stable disease, progression free survival and overall response.

PHARMACOKINETIC EVALUATIONS : Non-compartmental analysis will be conducted using WinNonlin. PK parameters of TAB006 including, but not limited to Tmax, Cmax, AUC, Vss, CL, t1/2, Cmin, The Cmin of toripalimab will also be reported. Dose proportionality for TAB006 will be assessed.

STATISTICAL METHODS Part A and Part B are based on the 3+3 design for dose escalation and safety evaluation requirements. Indication Phase, sample size is estimated using Simon's two-phase design minimax method.

All PK/Pharmacodynamic, immunogenicity, and safety data will be summarized and presented by cohort as well as overall for the study, using descriptive statistics (number of subjects, mean, median, standard deviation, minimum, and maximum) for continuous variables and using frequencies and percentages for discrete variables.

For analysis of ORR and DCR, 90% confidence intervals (CI) will be calculated using the Clopper-Pearson method. If the number of patients is higher than ten, 90% CI will be calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method for analysis of DoR, TTR, PFS, and OS.",0,NCT05253105,2026-02-05,2022-05-24,No Change,"A Clinical Study of TAB006 in Patients With Previously Treated, Advanced Malignancies",PHASE1,To assess the safety and tolerability of multiple doses of TAB006 in combination with toripalimab.,"Shanghai Junshi Bioscience Co., Ltd.",WITHDRAWN,2027-01,2022-03-15,TIGIT

"Carcinoma, Neuroendocrine","Background Neuroendocrine carcinomas (NECs) of gastro-entero-pancreatic (GEP) or unknown (UK) origin are rare and highly aggressive diseases. The recommended first-line (L1) treatment is platinum-etoposide combination therapy, which has a progression-free survival (PFS) of only 4-9 months and a median overall survival (OS) of approximately 12 months. All patients experience relapse, often rapidly after this first line of chemotherapy. The standard second-line (L2) chemotherapies recommended by ESMO, ENETS, and NCCN, FOLFIRI and FOLFOX, have modest efficacy with a PFS of 3 months and a median OS of 6 months. The BEVANEC study (PHRCK 2014, NCT02820857) reported no benefit of FOLFIRI + bevacizumab compared to FOLFIRI in a randomized phase II study that enrolled 150 patients in 26 centers over a period of 5 years in France.

To date, the most promising efficacy data for this highly aggressive cancer come from clinical trials of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) targeting the PD-1/PD-L1 checkpoint. For example, in France, the non-comparative phase II NIPINEC trial (NCT03591731) randomized patients to receive nivolumab +/- ipilimumab in L2/3 and achieved its primary evaluation criterion (ORR-8 weeks\>10%). Other trials in Europe and worldwide have also reported efficacy data in the context of single-arm studies.

Scientific Questions and Unmet Needs:

1. New therapeutic options/perspectives are necessary for patients with GEP/UK NECs given the limited overall survival.
2. Approximately 50% of patients experienced early progression under immunotherapy in the NIPINEC trial and other trials, which may be explained by the absence of chemotherapy combined with immunotherapy and/or the existence of resistance mechanisms.
3. In the GEP/UK NEC indication, the design of these immunotherapy trials has been non-comparative single-arm studies because the realization of randomized comparative trials is considered very difficult for these very rare cancers (incidence \<5/million).

Rationale for the REWENEC-01 Trial The DURIGAST PRODIGE 59 study, conducted by the FFCD, demonstrated the feasibility and safety of the FOLFIRI + double immune checkpoint inhibitor (anti-PD-1 and anti-CTLA4) combination, as well as for the combination Folfox-Domvanalimab-Zimberelimab (anti-PD-1 and anti-TIGIT). In a translational study of the immune phenotype in patients with NECs treated with the anti-PD1 pembrolizumab, an increase in TIGIT expression was observed after pembrolizumab treatment and higher TIGIT expression on T cells in the blood of patients with high Ki67 expression in their tumors. These data suggest that TIGIT is a potential complementary therapeutic target to PD-1/PD-L1 checkpoint inhibition in GEP/UK NECs. Domvanalimab has been developed as an anti-TIGIT monoclonal antibody and zimberelimab as an anti-PD-1.

Design and primary objective of the REWNEC-01 Trial The REWENEC-01 trial is a comparative phase II trial that will randomize GEP/UK NEC patients between an experimental arm FOLFIRI+Zimberelimab + Domvanalimab and a control arm FOLFIRI in L2. The FOLFIRI arm will be a ""hybrid"" synthetic control arm composed of patients from historical/external data from the FOLFIRI arm of BEVANEC and French retrospective studies RBNEC and CEPD, mixed with patients recruited prospectively during the trial and randomized to the control arm. The randomization ratio for patients included prospectively during the trial will be 4:1 (4 patients assigned to FOLFIRI+Zimberelimab + Domvanalimab for 1 patient assigned to FOLFIRI). The randomization algorithm will take into account ""external"" patients assigned progressively to the control arm to obtain a 1:1 ratio between the trial arms, with balanced distributions of stratification factors between the two arms.

With 77 patients to be included, this strategy will provide statistical power equivalent to that of a trial including 122 patients, sufficient to demonstrate an advantage in overall survival rate at 12 months from 32% to 50%.

The hypotheses related to efficacy criteria are formulated a priori, as recommended by the FDA guidance document on trials with synthetic/external control arms. The proof of concept has been reported at ESMO 2023. The primary judgment criterion will be the overall survival rate at 12 months because it is a strong and significant criterion for translating the clinical benefit of the Chemotherapy + Zimberelimab + Domvanalimab combination. The design with a hybrid synthetic control arm allows for the consideration of a randomized comparative study in a cancer as rare as neuroendocrine carcinoma.",122,NCT07337447,2026-02-05,2026-01-07,No Change,Trial of FOLFIRI + Zimberelimab + Domvanalimab vs FOLFIRI With a Hybrid Synthetic Control Arm in Second Line Treatment of Neuroendocrine Carcinoma of Gastro-enteropancreatic or Unknown Origin (REWENEC 01),PHASE2,Overall survival (%) between FOLFIRI and FOLFIRI+Zimberelimab+Domvanalimab,Hospices Civils de Lyon,NOT_YET_RECRUITING,2030-04,2026-04,TIGIT

Locoregionally Advanced Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma (LA-HNSCC),"This is a phase II, open-label study to assess the efficacy of AZD2936 in terms of molecular residual disease (MRD) clearance and treatment outcome in patients with MRD after definitive treatment for high risk locoregionally advanced head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (LA-HNSCC). MRD is defined as ctDNA detection in plasma after definitive treatment. Approximately 200 patients are expected to be enrolled.

The study is divided in 5 parts:

Part A and Part B are common for all patients in the study, which are defined as the periods of definitive treatment and post definitive treatment. Definitive treatment will be either surgery followed by radiation or chemoradiation; definitive radiation or definitive chemoradiation according to standard of care (SOC) in our institution. A baseline ctDNA sample collection and CT staging will be done before treatment. ctDNA analysis will be performed in Part B at approximately week 5 and at week 10 of this period, and patients will be classified as MRD positive or MRD negative based on the week 10 results. If a patient has equivocal results, a new sample will be taken around week 14. Patients who receive surgery as part of their treatment, will also get ctDNA analysis post-surgery.

Part C is the randomized and interventional part of the study (n=60) for patients with MRD. The patient will be randomized 3:1 to Arm A (treatment with AZD2936) or Arm B (observation). Patients in Arm A will continue treatment until the occurrence of any of these circumstances: after completion of 6 cycles, intolerable toxicity or patient decision. ctDNA analysis will be done at week 10 of Part C.

Part D is the follow up part for patients with MRD. Two ctDNA samples will be analyzed at week 2 and at week 10 of Part D. Plasma samples will be collected every 6 months for the first 3 years and a final sample will be also collected if the patient has radiological or clinical progression. A CT/MRI scan will be performed at week 2 of Part D and, if clinically needed, according to SOC.

Part E is the observational follow up part for patients without MRD.

OUTLINE: This is a phase II, multi-arm, open-label trial of perioperative atezolizumab alone or in combination with other immune-modulating agents in advanced SCCHN. Based on the results of these initial cohorts, the trial will be amended to explore other novel atezolizumab-based combinations (such as atezolizumab in combination with another immuno-oncology (IO) agent, chemotherapeutics, or a molecularly targeted agent that could potentiate the activity of atezolizumab). Each of these new cohorts will be tested and enrolled to in sequential, non-randomized fashion.

Arm A: Patients receive 2 infusions of atezolizumab intravenously (IV) over 30-60 minutes for up to 15 days prior to definitive surgery and radiation.

Arm A (Adjuvant): Patients received 2 infusions of atezolizumab intravenously (IV) over 30-60 minutes for up to 15 days prior to definitive surgery and radiation. In addition to neoadjuvant atezolizumab, the first 9 participants in Arm A (atezolizumab monotherapy) received adjuvant atezolizumab beginning 16 weeks after surgery and radiation, or chemoradiation therapy, every 3 weeks for up to 12 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Adjuvant atezolizumab will only be initiated if radiation-associated adverse events have resolved to grade 2 or better.

Solid Tumor,"This study design for center, openness, dose escalation, and expand the research of phase I clinical trials, research the main evaluation BAT6021 injection for single or combined Tislelizumab in patients with advanced malignant solid tumors in the safety, tolerability and PK characteristics, to explore the maximum tolerated dose and preliminary antitumor efficacy, provide the basis for subsequent clinical trials recommended dose.

The study is divided into two parts:

Part I: single drug dose escalation study. Accelerated titration and ""3+3"" dose escalation rule were used to explore the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetic characteristics of BAT6021.

Since the clinical benefit of a single agent may be limited, the study used accelerated titration and the ""3+3"" dose-escalation rule to explore the safe dose range from the ethical point of view of exposing fewer subjects to ineffective doses. A total of 8 dose groups were set up, including 1mg (initial dose) group, 3mg group, 10mg group, 30mg group, 100mg group, 300mg group, 600mg group and 900mg group, respectively. The whole is divided into two phases. The first stage: 1mg group, 3mg group, 10mg group using accelerated titration method dose increase. The second stage: 30mg group, 100mg group, 300mg group, 600mg group, 900mg group according to the standard ""3+3"" rule for dose increase study.

If MTD is found, the sponsor may select a dose of MTD or lower as the recommended dose for phase II clinical studies after discussion with the investigator based on the specific situation. If MTD is not reached, the sponsor may select a dose of MAD or one of the following dose groups as the recommended dose for phase II clinical studies, depending on the specific situation and discussion with the investigator. As the study progresses, protocols may be allowed to revise the definition of DLT as appropriate in light of new clinical findings. Adverse events that meet DLT criteria occurring outside the DLT evaluation period or other adverse safety information that the investigator considers meaningful do not directly influence dose-escalation decisions, but should be taken into account in the final determination of THE RP2D. Prior to each dose increase, the sponsor and investigator will discuss and comprehensively evaluate the decision to increase or decrease the dose, using available information on safety, PK (if any), and efficacy.

Prior to inclusion in the next dose team, all subjects in the previous dose group must complete 21 days of DLT observation before toleration is explored according to the standard ""3+3"" dose escalation rule. In dose-escalation studies, the first subject in the same dose group may be included in the next subject 1 week after the first dose observation. Within each dose group, a minimum of 24 hours should be allowed between the administration of the prior subject and the administration of subsequent subjects.

Dose reduction adjustments are not allowed. The dose of BAT6021 should be upregulated as appropriate, but with extreme caution, at least simultaneously: (1) Subjects have received at least 4 cycles of study medication; (2) After discussion between the sponsor and the study, it was concluded that the subjects receiving the higher primary dose group might bring more clinical benefits than the current dose group; (3) The higher dose group has been shown to fail to reach MTD by subsequent dose escalation studies.

Part TWO: the study of dose escalation for combined administration. In BAT6021 combined with Tislelizumab of dose escalation study, before start the combination therapy, sponsor should communicate with CDE and ethics committee, submit BAT6021 single drug dose escalation stage research data.

In the dose extension study, according to the preliminary safety and efficacy data of the dose escalation study, the investigator discussed with the sponsor to select the appropriate dose and tumor species for the extension study, so as to further study the safety and clinical efficacy of BAT6021 single drug or combined tislelizumab, providing a basis for subsequent clinical studies. In the monotherapy group, 1 to 2 dose cohorts were studied, with no less than 6 patients in each dose cohorts, and PK study was conducted for all patients. In the combined treatment group, 4-5 cohorts of different tumor types will be selected, with no less than 20 patients in each cohort. In some cohorts for PK studies, no less than 6 subjects were included in PK studies.

The overall study period can be roughly divided into screening period, treatment period and follow-up period:

Screening period: -28d\~0d, that is, after the informed consent is signed, the screening evaluation can be completed within 28 days;

Treatment period: There will be one administration cycle every 3 weeks, and the study drug will be given on the first day of each cycle. Starting from the second cycle, the time window of administration can be ±3 days. However, in addition to imaging examination, subjects must complete all tests including vital signs, laboratory examination, and physical status score within 72 hours before each administration. Subjects were also required to complete clinical tumor radiographic evaluations (consistent, CT or MRI) at a frequency of once every 6 weeks (±7 days) within 24 weeks of initial dosing and once every 9 weeks (±7 days) thereafter. Study drug therapy should continue until withdrawal due to disease progression, or unacceptable toxicity, or new antitumor therapy due to no therapeutic benefit, or withdrawal of informed consent and other reasons, or study termination, whichever comes first. The study termination time shall be 1 year after the last subject receives study medication or all subjects leave the study, whichever comes first.

The DLT evaluation period was defined as the first treatment cycle, from initial dosing to 21 days after dosing.

Follow-up period: If the investigator decides to discontinue study drug Therapy, the EOT will be considered as the End of Therapy. EOT visits will be scheduled for all subjects, including those who have discontinued treatment for any reason other than loss of follow-up, death, or withdrawal of informed consent, within 21+7 days of the investigator's decision to discontinue the subject's study medication and prior to the subject receiving subsequent new antitumor therapy. EOT visits should include vital signs, physical examination, laboratory examination, and clinical tumor imaging evaluation (CT or MRI).

Safety follow-up: After receiving the last dose of study drug, the subjects were required to undergo safety visits at 21 (+7), 60 (±7), and 90 (±7) days, including immune-related adverse events (irAE). Until 90 days or subjects receive new antitumor therapy. Safety visits should be conducted at the study center, where vital signs, physical examination, laboratory examination and other examinations should be performed to evaluate AE, concomitant medication and concomitant treatment. Disappear until related to study drug adverse reaction (or fell to a level 1 or less), the subjects after stop treatment if adverse reaction still exists, the researchers have discretion, in combination with the practical situation of clinical decision follow-up frequency until researchers believe that the outcome of adverse reactions to restore normal, stable at an acceptable level, or there will be no further improvements.

Follow-up for survival: After the safe follow-up, the subjects were followed up once every 12 weeks (±14 days) by telephone until death, loss of follow-up, withdrawal of informed consent or termination of the study.

The longest treatment time of the drugs studied in this project is about 1 year. In the absence of disease progression or intolerance of toxicity 1 year after initial study use, subjects may return to the study facility and be continued by the investigator until disease progression occurs.",5,NCT05120375,2026-02-05,2023-10-08,No Change,Assessment of Safety and Preliminary Efficacy With BAT6021 in Solid Tumor Patients in China,PHASE1,Dose-limiting toxicity(DLT),Bio-Thera Solutions,TERMINATED,2023-04-07,2022-02-17,TIGIT
"Kidney Transplant Rejection, Kidney Transplantation, Risk Stratification, Prognosis","Allograft rejection is still a major threat to allografts with thousands of allografts failing every year worldwide due to organ rejection, with immediate consequences for the patients in terms of mortality and morbidity. With a prevalence around 20% in the first-year post transplant, rejection also carries high economic impact representing a 72% increase in transplantation price and downstream cost because of return on dialysis (60,000€ health care increase per patient). The rough estimates from 200,000 kidney allograft failures per year equals to 12 billion extra cost for the health care system per year.

Various explanations may be involved: 1) The current stratification system relies on various elements of the follow up of standard of care after kidney transplantation (histology, immunology) taken separately and, 2) Current therapeutic strategy is a ""one fit for all"" approach. Literature data show that therapeutics are not individualized, with 98% of patients having the same immunosuppressive regimens without analysis of response to therapy; 3) Lack of integration of omics in the stratification process. Today, the only approaches used to monitor the advent of immune-mediated allograft damage are nonspecific markers such as serum creatinine level and proteinuria which are not integrated in a dynamic approach. Some kidney transplant programs have implemented surveillance allograft biopsies, but they lack specificity and sensitivity and do not provide etiopathology of the underlying process. This impairs the risk stratification process.

In this project, leading European scientific teams, which have created relevant population cohorts and expertise, have joined forces to allow for large-scale (\>5,000 patients) risk prediction studies in the field of kidney transplantation. The overall goal of the EUropean TRAnsplantation and INnovation consortium (EU-TRAIN) is to prevent kidney allograft failure and improve allograft survival by informing clinical decision and delivering optimised interventions to patients at individual level. The project aims to improve the current gold standard for risk stratification and prognosis among kidney transplant recipients.

The members of the EU-TRAIN consortium have invested heavily in the last decade to create large highly detailed European kidney transplant cohorts and to achieve best level scientific expertise in the assessment of innovative biomarkers and rejection reclassification on the basis of disease mechanism using gene expression. Ground-breaking concrete results have already been obtained that have changed patient care and transplant medicine guidelines: This is underlined by highly cited publications in the leading specialised journals and also in journals aimed at a popular audience that underlines the systemic nature of this approach, (NEJM (n=10), Lancet (n=2), BMJ (n=1), JASN (n=18)). Using this approach, the investigators have recently identified new forms of allograft rejection, resulting in changes in the most recent international allograft Banff classification and reclassifying rejection diagnosis and disease stage. This research strategy also led to recently demonstrate the clinical relevance of new non-invasive biomarkers for defining the pathogenicity of anti-HLA antibodies and allograft loss risk assessment and incorporate gene expression measurements in allograft rejection risk stratification.

The EU-TRAIN project will further elevate these cohorts synergistically by adding data on novel biomarkers, so far underdeveloped in kidney transplant research, in particular genomics and immunological data. A comprehensive integration strategy of these exceptionally large and complete cohorts constitutes a quantum leap in transplant research, and offers a unique opportunity, out of reach so far, to design strategies for truly personalised medicine.

The expected benefit for participants and society will be to reduce the financial burden of graft rejection for society.

500 new transplanted patients in the 7 clinical transplant sites will be included in the prospective multicentre EU-TRAIN cohort with centralised analysis of samples in CHUN (blood mRNA), ICS (blood cellular assays), Charité (non-HLA antibodies and blood endothelial targets), AP-HP (blood anti-HLA DSA), and INSERM (Biopsy mRNA).

Non -Small Cell Lung Cancer,"Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is the leading cause of cancer related mortality worldwide. Immune checkpoint blockade has emerged as a promising treatment modality in NSCLC. More recently, Programmed Cell Death 1 (PD-1) inhibitor was approved by FDA as ≥ second line treatment, which are major paradigm shift in NSCLC treatment.

Subsequently two randomized phase III trials, comparing the overall survival (OS) of nivolumab with that of docetaxel as second line therapy, were completed. CheckMate-017 included squamous cell lung cancer patients and CheckMate-057 did non-squamous cell lung cancer patients. In both trials, nivolumab showed improvement of OS in all-comers regardless of PD-L1 expression. As a result of retrospective analysis, PD-L1 positivity was not predictive factor for the efficacy in squamous cell histology, but predictive factor for non-squamous histology. Finally, nivolumab was approved the all-comer NSCLC patients regardless of PD-L1 expression after failure to platinum based chemotherapy.

Although tumor PD-L1 expression is currently the best predictive biomarker for PD-1 blockades, the prediction accuracy is not high enough to solidify the drug efficacy. Actually, PD-L1 negative patients can still respond to PD-1 blockades and some of PD-L1 positive patients do not respond to these therapy. Interestingly, the responders among PD-L1 negative patients showed comparable duration of response in those with PD-L1 positive in Checkmate 057 trial.

Therefore, we need to select patients who are most likely to benefit from anti-PD-1 therapy and identify the better biomarker to predict the response to PD-1 blockades in NSCLC patients earlier than tumor assessment by imaging scan. To maximize the benefit of nivolumab in NSCLC patients, nivolumab should apply to all-comers, but we need to early decide to go or stop depending on predictive biomarker after 1st or 2nd cycle.

It is well known that various immune suppressive mechanisms including an accumulation and activation of myeloid derived suppressor cells (MDSC) and regulatory T cells (Tregs) exist in tumor microenvironment of cancer patients. MDSC are one of the major components of the tumor microenvironment, demonstrating their potentials, such as tumor progression by promoting tumor cell survival, angiogenesis, invasion of healthy tissue by tumor cells, and metastases. Recent studies show that MDSC as a heterogenous group of myeloid progenitors with immuno suppressive function could be used as one of the promising biomarker candidate for cancer immunotherapies. Ipilimumab could affect the immune cells in peripheral blood from melanoma patients. This study demonstrated that responder to ipilimumab showed early increase of eosinophil counts, whereas non-responders presented that elevated monocytic MDSC increased serum levels of S100A8/A9 and HMGB1 that attract and activate MDSCs. This result suggests that measurement of MDSCs could be a predictive immune related biomarker to ipilimumab treatment. On the other hand, we do not know how PD-1 blockade affects the immune suppressive cells such as MDSC or Tregs and makes difference between responder and non-responder.

Recently, we conducted pilot trial to compare the T lymphocytes and MDSC population in peripheral blood between responder and non-responder to nivolumab. Interestingly, our preliminary data demonstrated that after 1st cycle of the therapy CD11b+CD33+MDSC/CD45+ or CD14- ratio has significantly decreased in responder compared to non-responder. The cut-off value of peripheral MDSC ratio could be reliable biomarker for accurate prediction of nivolumab therapy in NSCLC patients. To validate our finding, we need to expand this study in NSCLC patients who will be treated with nivolumab.",60,NCT03486119,2026-02-05,2020-10-14,No Change,A Study for Identification of Predictive Immune Biomarker in Peripheral Blood for Nivolumab Therapy in NSCLC Patients,N/A,MDSC markers,Yonsei University,COMPLETED,2020-07-07,2018-02-05,TIGIT

Locally Advanced Esophageal Squamous Cell Carcinoma,"Esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) is one of the most lethal malignancy worldwide. The prognosis is poor with a five-year overall survival rate of 10 to 30 %. Randomized clinical trials have demonstrated that trimodality therapy (TMT), consisted of neoadjuvant concurrent chemoradiation (CCRT) and radical esophagectomy, improves the overall survival for patients with resectable locally advanced disease. Despite of the advancement, the outcome remained unsatisfactory with the median recurrence-free survival around 20 to 25 months and median overall survival around 30 months. It is known that the most important prognostic factor is whether a pathological complete response can be achieved after neoadjuvant CCRT. However, the use of new generation chemotherapeutic agent and epidermal growth factor inhibitors failed to significantly improve prognosis comparing to the standard platinum-based regimen. As a consequence, it is mandatory to develop new pharmacotherapeutic regimen for TMT.

In our previous prospective studies, we found higher levels of serum immune-related biomarkers, VEGF-A, TGF-β1, and soluble PD-L1, before neoadjuvant CCRT were independent associated with inferior overall survival and disease-free survival for locally advanced ESCC treated with neoadjuvant CCRT plus radical esophagectomy. Recent clinical trials have shown the efficacy of anti-PD-1 in recurrent/metastatic ESCC. Besides, preclinical and clinical studies suggested radiotherapy might induce local inflammatory stimulus for the immune modulating drug to boost the integrated response. In addition, preclinical study showed promising anti-cancer efficacy by combination of fractionated radiotherapy, anti-PD-L1 and/or anti-TIGIT immunotherapy. Though several prospective clinical trials have shown the feasibility, safety, and activity of adding anti-TIGIT therapy to anti-PD-L1 drug, and adding anti-PD-L1 therapy to chemotherapy in lung cancer, the safety and activity of combing anti-PD-1/PD-L1 to CCRT or TMT remained largely undetermined. In the present clinical trial, we plan to investigate whether incorporation of tiragolumab (Anti-TIGIT) and atezolizumab (Anti-PD-L1) into standard TMT will be safe while improve the pathological complete response rate. By the present research, we expect to develop a new TMT regimen for this poor prognostic disease.

This study is a single arm open labeled trial to evaluate the safety and pathological response of ESCC patients receiving neoadjuvant Paclitaxel/Cisplatin(TP)-CCRT plus Tiragolumab/Atezolizumab followed by radical esophagectomy.

Advanced Solid Tumor,"Anti-PD-1 and anti-PD-L1 antibodies targeting the immuno-inhibitory PD-1 pathway (thus activating T cells) have achieved clinical success in many types of cancers. However, studies have shown that anti-TIGIT antibodies not only trigger T cells and Natural Killer(NK) cells, but they can also activate T cells to a greater extent than anti-PD-1 antibodies. Therefore, further clinical investigation of anti-TIGIT antibodies such as BAT6021 is warranted.

PD-1 and TIGIT are commonly co-expressed in T cells of the same tumor; thus, combining anti-TIGIT antibodies with PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors may be a more effective cancer treatment. Indeed, anti-TIGIT antibodies have demonstrated synergy with anti-PD-1/PD-L1 antibodies in preclinical models. In addition, sponsor have shown that single administration of BAT1308 or BAT6021 could not effectively inhibit CT26 tumor growth in PD-1/TIGIT- humanized syngeneic mice; however, the combination treatment resulted in potent anti-tumor activity.

Basal Cell Carcinoma,"PDT is a technique that works by combining a photosensitizing topical agent and an intense light to kill tumor cells. PDT is not currently approved for the treatment of BCC by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), although it is approved for that purpose in many European countries.

This is an internally (bilaterally) controlled trial that will enroll 24 participants with biopsy-proven BCC who are planning to undergo tumor removal via Mohs surgery. Within this cohort, one tumor will be PDT-treated and the other left as an untreated control. This study is also a cohort-controlled trial, because discarded tissue from fully de-identified Mohs participants will be analyzed after routine Mohs surgery, in order to establish the baseline variability in tumor-infiltrating immune cell parameters in non-PDT-treated participants.

The objectives of this study are:

To determine the time to maximum expression of immune checkpoint molecules in BCC tumors and peri-tumoral stroma after PDT, as compared to untreated tumors.

To determine the ratio of cytotoxic T cells to regulatory T cells in BCC tumors and peri-tumoral stroma after PDT, as compared to untreated tumors.

To determine whether circulating T-cells, collected from patients' peripheral blood, sampled before and after PDT treatment of a BCC tumor, show a higher proportion of tumor-activated CD8+ T-cells after PDT.

Safety assessments (including dose-limiting toxicities \[DLTs\], adverse events, clinical laboratory tests, vital signs, physical examinations, and 12-lead ECGs), exploratory efficacy evaluations, and PK/PD assessments are conducted through Day 28 in accordance with the schedule of assessments.

Exploratory efficacy assessments through Day 28 include changes from baseline in the following clinical measures: Inflammatory Neuropathy Cause and Treatment (INCAT) disability score, Medical Research Council (MRC) total sum score, Inflammatory Rasch-Built Overall Disability Scale (I-RODS), Timed Up-and-Go (TUG) test, mean grip strength, and the Overall Neuropathy Limitations Scale (ONLS).

Pharmacodynamic (PD) assessments include immunophenotyping of CD4+ T-cell subsets (CD4, CD25, FOXP3, CD39, CD69, CTLA-4, LAG-3, TNFR2, TIGIT, CCR5, and CXCR3); measurement of serum cytokines and immunoglobulins (IgM, IgG, IL-2, IL-6, IL-10, IL-17, IFN-γ, MCP-1, and TGF-β); evaluation of autoantibody and complement markers (antinuclear antibodies, anti-SM, anti-RNP, anti-SSA, anti-double-stranded DNA antibodies, and complement C4); and additional laboratory parameters related to systemic inflammation.

Colon Cancer Liver Metastasis,"Despite advance in the diagnosis and treatment of colorectal cancer (CRC), it remains the second most common cause of cancer-related death in the US and the UK. The majority of deaths from CRC are related to distant metastases, predominantly to the liver.

There are observational and laboratory data supporting the notion that the omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) has anti-CRC activity. These include a phase 2 'window of opportunity' randomised, placebo-controlled trial of EPA provided before surgery for resection of CRC liver metastasis (called the EMT study). A signal that EPA improved progression-free and overall survival after liver surgery provided the rationale for the EMT2 trial, which is a randomised, double-blind placebo-controlled phase 3 trial of the effect of EPA (started before surgery but continued post-operatively) on CRC recurrence and survival after surgery for resectable liver metastases \[ClinicalTrials.gov NCT03428477 and EudraCT Number: 2016-000628-24\].

The mechanism(s) by which EPA might influence post-operative survival are not well understood. Recent data support the idea that the anti-CRC benefit of EPA may be mediated by modulating the intestinal microbiota and ameliorating tumour-permissive immunosuppressive mechanisms, including inhibition of the activity of regulatory T cells (Tregs) and myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), as well as reduced synthesis of inflammatory mediators such as prostaglandin (PG) E2 and chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 2 (CCL2). Mice fed with a high-EPA-containing diet demonstrate 1) increased abundance of gut bacteria, such as Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus genera that support the host anti-tumour immune response and improve the efficacy of cancer immunotherapy, and 2) decreased abundance of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-producing bacteria that trigger chronic inflammation and can promote CRC. These data support a hypothesis that a prebiotic effect of EPA abrogates intra-tumoural immunosuppression and ameliorates systemic inflammation to improve survival of CRCLM patients.

EMT2 trial participants are ideally placed to provide biospecimens that can be analysed in order to understand the mechanism(s) of action of EPA given that the laboratory data can eventually be linked to the clinical outcomes from the trial. Biospecimens can be obtained without interference with the EMT2 trial protocol. Stool, urine, and blood samples will be obtained 1) after EMT2 trial randomization, before starting EPA or placebo, 2) just before surgery, and 3) at 6-monthly intervals thereafter, plus liver metastases tumour tissue during surgery. Using these biospecimens, the microbiome and immune pathways altered by EPA will be investigated in relation to participant survival. Mechanistic insights about the anti-CRC activity of EPA from the biospecimen collection project will maximize the knowledge and insights gained from the EMT2 trial and its participants, thereby leading to personalized use of EPA, which will be targeted at those most likely to benefit.",81,NCT04682665,2026-02-05,2024-12-03,No Change,Prebiotic Effect of Eicosapentaenoic Acid Treatment for Colorectal Cancer Liver Metastases,N/A,"Abundance of individual bacterial taxa in the gut microbiome (eg.

"Cutaneous T Cell Lymphoma (CTCL), Mycosis Fungoides, Sezary Syndrome","Cutaneous T-cell lymphomas (CTCL) are a heterogeneous group of lymphomas characterized by a primary involvement of the skin. Among them, mycosis fungoides (MF) and Sézary syndrome (SS) are the most common subtypes. SS is defined as erythroderma (erythema of the entire skin surface), and circulating tumor blood cells. The circulating tumor T cells express CD4 and may lose expression of CD7 and CD26, while exhibiting in most cases aberrant expression of CD158k (KIR3DL2), which is a surface marker of Sézary cells. CCR8 is a surface marker of tumor-infiltrating regulatory T cells. It has recently be observed that CCR8 was expressed by tumor cells in CTCL and other peripheral T-cell lymphomas. CCR8 is expressed by skin resident-memory T cells which are believed to be the tumor cell-of-origin in mycosis fungoides. Domain Therapeutics (DT) showed the in vitro efficacy of their proprietary anti-CCR8 mAb DT7012 in the depletion of CTCL cells. Therapeutic depletion of CCR8-expressing cells by DT-7012 could eliminate tumor cells and activate the anti-tumor immunity in CTCL.

HIV,"The aim of antiretroviral (ARV) treatment is to inhibit viral replication in order to achieve an undetectable plasma viral load. The threshold of undetectability to be achieved differs from country to country and from learned societies to learned societies, and is set at 50 copies/mL at 6 months of treatment initiation in French recommendations (Morlat, 2018), 200 copies/mL in US recommendations (Thompson et al., 2021), and 1,000 copies/mL in recommendations published by the World Health Organization (WHO) (World Health Organization, 2016), the latter threshold being the one used by all resource-limited countries.

Currently, the vast majority of patients treated with ARVs are virologically suppressed, with viral load below the quantification threshold of the viral load technique (20 to 50 copies/mL, classically) (Elvstam et al., 2023). Nevertheless, a non-negligible percentage of patients, up to 10% in a recent American study (Fleming et al., 2019), may present persistent viremia (i.e., on several consecutive viral loads) of low level (between 51 and 1,000 copies/mL).The risk of persistent viral replication under antiretroviral pressure is to favor the emergence of resistance mutations, which can impact the activity of an ARV molecule or all the molecules in a therapeutic class (Assoumou et al., JAC, 2017; Elvstam et al., CID, 2023). The phenomenon of persistent plasma viremia has been shown to be more frequently observed with certain ARV classes such as protease inhibitors. However, few data are currently available on the most recent ARVs, such as 2nd-generation integrase inhibitors (INIs) and the most recent non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI), doravirin. These latest-generation molecules have specific profiles. For example, 2nd-generation INIs present a high genetic barrier to resistance, while doravirine has the advantage of having a genotypic resistance profile distinct from other NNRTIs, and of diffusing well across compartments.

These persistent low levels of viremia raise numerous questions in terms of clinical management, and may lead to changes in therapy. We therefore need to better understand the mechanism(s) behind these persistent low viremia levels, so that we can provide the best possible care for PLWHA.However, in the absence of a clear explanation of the mechanism underlying this low-noise replication, management of this clinical situation is often difficult and sub-optimal. In fact, the therapeutic intensifications proposed (addition of a 4th agent or switch to another 3rd agent that does not exist as a single tablet) can complicate the patient's regimen, and therefore impact on compliance. At present, it is often proposed to closely monitor patients with persistent low viremia, which can be stressful for the patient, in addition to generating healthcare costs due to the close follow-up visits and biological tests prescribed.Various mechanisms could be at the root of this persistent low-level viremia: persistence of low-level viral replication, notably through release from anatomical reservoirs, clonal expansion of provirus-carrying cells that can be reactivated following polyclonal stimulation, or the production of non-infectious virus from mutation-carrying proviruses (Elvstam et al., 2019; Halvas et al., 2020; Simonetti et al., 2016) (Figure 2). These mechanisms are all linked to the particularity of the HIV cycle, which is the ability of its genome to integrate as double-stranded DNA into the cellular genome. This integrated viral DNA, also known as provirus, constitutes the reservoir. The vast majority of proviruses present in the cellular reservoir are defective, i.e. not replication-competent (Bender et al., 2019). Different types of mutations are responsible for these defective proviruses: i) the appearance of stop codons due to G-to-A mutations in the viral genome, selected by host immune pressure mechanisms such as the APOBEC (Apolipoprotein B mRNA-editing Enzyme Catalytic polypeptide-like) enzyme, ii) mutations in key regions, such as 5' LTR (Long Terminal Repeat), and iii) larger or smaller deletions of the proviral genome.A recent study compared plasma viruses with proviruses in 8 patients with persistent low plasma viremia (White et al., 2023). The proviral genomes that contributed to plasma viremia differed from proviral genomes not found in plasma viruses, notably in terms of integration sites in the human genome and transcriptomics in the CD4 cells that host them. This suggests that certain proviruses may be specifically responsible for low-noise viral replication. The mechanism by which these proviruses are activated is not determined, but could result from random reactivations due to higher levels of systemic inflammation and immune activation. Other work has suggested that clonal expansion of certain provirus-bearing CD4+ T cells may play a role in the persistence of low-level viremia (Simonetti et al., 2016). This clonal expansion is a random process and, in this scenario, the viruses produced might not generate new productive infections, due to effective ARV concentrations.In this study, we will explore different hypotheses concerning the origin of these persistent plasma viremias by studying the viral reservoir in patients with and without persistent low-level viremia, and by investigating the association between viral reservoir levels and different parameters of immune activation, inflammation and immune exhaustion.",80,NCT07015164,2026-02-05,2025-06-03,No Change,"Role of Viral Reservoir, Immune Activation and Depletion in Persistent Viremia Persistent Viremia in People Living With HIV on Antiretroviral Therapy",N/A,Quantification of HIV-1 cellular reservoir parameters using molecular techniques,Assistance Publique - Hôpitaux de Paris,NOT_YET_RECRUITING,2026-09-11,2025-06-10,TIGIT

Oligorecurrent and Oligoprogressive Prostate Cancer Patients,"Prostate cancer (PC) represents the second most common cancer in men worldwide, managed with surgery or radiotherapy (RT) in case of localized disease.

Advanced PC can metastasize and often presents as an oligometastatic state, defined as an intermediate state between localized and widespread diffused disease. Oligometastatic PC is characterized by the presence of a limited number of metastases, commonly 1 to 5 lesions. Recently, the ESTRO-EORTC collaboration characterized the oligometastatic disease and provided a classification into oligorecurrence, and oligoprogression, considering whether oligometastatic disease is diagnosed during a treatment-free interval or during active systemic therapy.

Most common sites of metastases from PC are bones and lymph nodes. Different studies have been already published for oligometastatic PC patients. Singh et al. reported that a number of metastases limited to 5, developed during follow-up after curative treatment of primary tumor, is significantly associated to a better 5-year survival rate (73% vs 43% of patients with more than 5 metastases).

In case of limited number of metastases, stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) seems to be effective but its role in the management of metastatic PC is still debated, due to the paucity of prospective and randomized trials.

We reported the outcome of 92 oligometastatic PC patients treated with SBRT, reaching 1 and 3 years control of treated lesions in 90.9% (95%CI 81.8 - 95.6) and 85.5% (95%CI 74.4 - 92.0), and a median overall survival of 91.6 months.

Ost et al. conducted a randomized trial comparing surveillance versus metastases directed therapy in a sample of 62 hormone naïve metastatic PC patients. With a median follow-up time of 3 years, the median ADT-free survival was 13 months for surveillance group versus 21 for the treatment group. In terms of PFS, the median time until progression was 6 months for the surveillance group, as compared with 10 months for the MDT group (p = 0.03).

Main benefits from SBRT in oligometastatic setting are potentially the increasing time of freedom from systemic therapy in naïve patients the delay of the intensification of systemic therapy in patients already under treatment. Moreover another relevant advantage from SBRT is the ability to modulate the tumor immune microenvironment as showed by preliminary studies. In particular, SBRT has been shown to induce immune responses in treated patients with potentially improved tumor control.

RT is able to elicit a potent anti-tumour immune response, driven by the activation of T cells infiltrating the tumor and the increase of antigen-presenting cell cross-presentation, and on the other hand, also seems to enhance immunosuppression in cancer, mainly mediated by the recruitment and activation of anti-inflammatory and pro-tumorigenic myeloid cell subsets. The immune landscape of patients may interfere with the efficacy of radiation therapy and, on the other side, SBRT may modulate the immune response by driving immuno-tolerance.

The impact of RT may vary depending on tumor type and time of delivery. In addition the immune modulation determined by RT may depend on the dose per fraction. On this regard ablative dose of fractionated radiations were shown to elicit an anti-tumorigenic response mediated by T cell activation in a model of breast cancer, that was not observed at conventional doses. So far, no relevant studies have been published regarding the role of SBRT in the immune modulation of metastatic PC patients. Neither the combination of SBRT and androgen deprivation has been explored prospectively in terms of immune response. This however is an area of interest, considering that preclinical studies showed that hormonal therapy seems to increase the numbers of circulating naive T cells shortly after beginning of ADT, and decrease numbers of circulating CD4+ Treg. At the same time infiltrating myeloid subsets have been reported to facilitate resistance to ADT in mouse models of PC.

At the moment there is a lack of data in the setting of oligometastatic PC in particular regarding the interaction between ablative SBRT, ADT and patient's immune system response.

The hypothesis underlying this project consists in the idea that the patient's immunological context, RT and ADT may interact in the context of metastatic PC. Indeed the immune landscape of patients may interfere with the efficacy of SBRT and on the other side RT may modulate the immune response by driving immunotolerance.

Scope of the study will be to investigate the immune modulation after SBRT in:

* patients with diagnosis of oligorecurrence during a treatment-free interval
* patients with oligoprogression or oligopersistance during hormonal therapy",40,NCT04624828,2026-02-05,2025-04-22,No Change,Immune Response Evaluation in Oligorecurrent and Oligoprogressive Prostate Cancer Patients Treated With SBRT,NA,immune evaluation,Istituto Clinico Humanitas,ACTIVE_NOT_RECRUITING,2026-07,2020-10-19,TIGIT

Lung Transplant Rejection,"Lung transplantation is the less common solid organ transplant performed; it is the treatment of choice for end stage lung disease. Lung transplantation is ""problematic"" for a number of reasons: low graft availability, high waitlist mortality and unsatisfactory survival. Acute rejection, occurring days to months after surgery, has been identified as one of the main risk factors for the development of chronic rejection: in the first five years after lung transplantation, chronic rejection is the major cause of graft failure, morbidity and mortality. A deep knowledge of the immunological scenarios associated with lung graft tolerance could allow selectively switch-off T-cells involved in the rejection process. The researches, preliminary demonstrated the central role of immunological checkpoints in the development of acute rejection and its evolution towards chronic rejection. The aim of this study is the identification of markers that could be associated with the establishment of lung graft tolerance.

The project is articulated into two parts: a retrospective and a prospective section. The retrospective section is constituted by a cross-sectional study of immune checkpoints on lungs explanted during lung re-transplantation for chronic rejection (cohort 1). In addition, the retrospective section includes a retrospective cohort study of immune checkpoints on specimens from transbronchial lung biopsies of participants who received lung transplantation and have 3 years of follow-up (cohort 2).

Melanoma,"Immunotherapy has helped many cancer patients in the last 5 years by enhancing a patient's immune system to fight cancer. Anti-Programmed Death (PD-1) immunotherapy drugs such as pembrolizumab and nivolumab remove the breaks from cancer-fighting immune cells and have been effective in treating some melanoma patients. Despite the major breakthrough of immunotherapy in oncology treatment, many patients do not respond to this new class of anti-cancer drugs. Recently, evidence suggests that the microorganisms living in a patient's intestines play a major role in modifying the response to anti-PD-1drugs. Patients who respond to these drugs have a unique and healthy group of microorganisms in their gut. Therefore, positive modification of a cancer patient's gut microorganisms to create a more diverse and healthy microbiome may improve the response to immunotherapy. One method of modifying the microbiome is Fecal Microbial Transplantation (FMT) that is already being successfully used in the clinic to treat non-cancer patients with persistent bacterial infections.

In this study, the investigators will combine FMT with the approved immunotherapy drugs pembrolizumab or nivolumab that are the standard of care for the treatment of advanced melanoma. The purpose of this study is to examine the safety of combining these two therapies in melanoma patients. The investigator will use fecal material from a healthy donor selected via our stringent protocol that is Health Canada approved. In addition to assessing the safety of the combination, the investigator will also study the effect of FMT on the immune system and microbial ecosystem of the gut.",20,NCT03772899,2026-02-05,2025-03-26,No Change,Fecal Microbial Transplantation in Combination With Immunotherapy in Melanoma Patients (MIMic),PHASE1,To evaluate the safety of combining Fecal Microbial Transplantation (FMT) using intestinal bacteria existing in the stool of healthy donors with immunotherapy in melanoma patients.,London Health Sciences Centre Research Institute OR Lawson Research Institute of St. Joseph's,ACTIVE_NOT_RECRUITING,2026-08,2019-03-27,TIGIT

HIV Infection Primary,"This is a Phase II, single-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial in People with Human Immunodeficiency Virus (PWH) on suppressive Combined Antiretroviral Therapy (cART).

The aim is to assess safety, tolerability and Impact of low dose Dasatinib, during 24 weeks, on Viral Persistence and Inflammation in this population.

Participants will be randomized (2:1) to receive oral Dasatinib 70 mg once daily or matched placebo for 24 weeks. At week 24, Dasatinib will be discontinued and participants will be followed until week 48, in a total of eleven visits. For all participants cART will remain unchanged during the entire study.

The hypotheses of the study is that:

* Daily administration of a low dose of dasatinib (70 mg once daily) to PWH for 24 weeks will be safe and well tolerated.
* Dasatinib will interfere with HIV-1 persistence mechanisms contributing to chronic immune activation and inflammation status in both concordant and immune-discordant virologically suppressed PWH.
* Dasatinib antiproliferative effect could have a significant impact on the HIV-1 reservoir size.

The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of Dasatinib in this setting.

Graft-versus-host Disease (GVHD),"Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) is the most effective treatment for acute leukaemia. The reconstitution of the recipient's immune system with donor-derived HSCT cells and the development of immune tolerance are critical to the success of HSCT. Patients who fail to establish immune tolerance after transplantation develop graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), which is a serious threat to patients' lives and quality of life.

Utilising single-cell multi-omics sequencing technology, the study's principal investigator elucidated the distribution of immune cell subpopulations in patients who successfully established immune tolerance post-transplantation. This research also identified a novel group of CD8 regulatory precursors (CD8 Trps), confirming their critical regulatory role in inducing immune tolerance in post-transplantation patients. This finding suggests that this subpopulation may serve as a novel target for predicting and intervening in GVHD. The successful implementation of this project will establish a new method for early prediction of GVHD and provide a new strategy for clinical intervention of GVHD.

The goal of this observational study is to explore the sensitivity and validity of the CD8 Trps as a novel biomarker molecule for predicting the development of GVHD through a prospective clinical cohort. The main question it aims to answer is:

Can the CD8 Trps serve as an effective molecular marker for the prediction of GVHD occurrence?

"Peritoneal Mesothelioma, Gestational Trophoblastic Tumor, Thymoma and Thymic Carcinoma, Anaplastic Thyroid Carcinomas, Gastroenteropancreatic Neuroendocrine Tumor, Carcinoid Tumor","Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) have revolutionized the management of advanced cancers. However, most rare cancers have been excluded from this progress due to the lack of clinical trials involving these diseases. After the standard first-line treatment, there are no other validated treatments for most of them. The management of these patients in ≥ 2nd line treatment relies on historic poorly effective regimens.

This creates an inequity between patients with frequent cancers beneficiating from medical progresses and approvals of innovative drugs, and patients with rare cancers are still treated with old and toxic drugs.

Few available data on case reports and early phase studies indicate a beneficial role of the immunotherapy in rare cancers.

The investigators assume that the combination of Domvanalimab and Zimberelimab is more effective than historical standard treatments in patients with 5 types of advanced rare cancers, after failure of at least one line of standard treatment in the advanced setting:

* Cohort 1: Peritoneal Mesotheliomas (PM)
* Cohort 2: Gestational Trophoblastic Tumors (GTT)
* Cohort 3: B3 Thymomas and Thymic Carcinomas (TET)
* Cohort 4: Refractory Thyroid Carcinomas (ATC)
* Cohort 5: GEP-NET and carcinoid tumors (GEP-NET (Gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumors)/TCT (Thoracic carcinoid tumor)/UP-NET (Neuroendocrine tumor of unknown primary))

The primary objective is to assess the efficacy of the combination of Domvanalimab and Zimberelimab in terms of progression-free survival rate at 24 weeks (for cohorts 1,3,5), successful hCG (Human Chorionic Gonadotropin) normalisation rate at 24 weeks for cohort 2 and survival rate for cohort 4.

The secondary objectives are to assess the efficacy of the combination of anti-TIGIT (T cell Immunoreceptor with Ig and ITIM domains) and anti-PD-1 (Programmed Death-1) immunotherapies in terms of overall response rate, progression-free survival (cohort 1-3 and 5), resistance-free survival (cohort 2), overall survival (cohorts 1-3 and 5), duration of the response (cohorts 1-3 and 5); and to assess the tolerability of the doublet of immunotherapy in terms of adverse events.

Patients will be treated until disease progression or alternatively 2 years in case of complete response (upon discussion with the coordinator of the study, the coordinator of the cohort and the investigator), unacceptable toxicity, or death. At the end of treatment, patients will be followed up for at least 1 year.

IMMUNORARE5 is composed of five independent open-label national multicenter single-arm phase II trials, sponsored by Lyon University Hospital, led in collaboration with the corresponding French national reference centers, with a centralized coordination by a dedicated team.

Each phase II trial is designed as a two-stage Simon design, with early termination for futility. For each cohort, a null hypothesis (H0) and an alternative hypotheses (H1) regarding the percentages of patients with success has been defined, with 5% one-sided alpha level and 80% power.

End Stage Renal Disease,"Tregs have been studied in clinical practice for different therapeutic applications. In the past several years there has been a significant interest in the transplant community to develop tolerance in order to substantially decrease or even eliminate the need of immuno-suppressive regimens. A growing body of evidence recognizes the balance between graft-reactive effector cells and graft-protective suppressor Treg cells as the ultimate determinant of long-term allograft survival. As a result, there is a major interest in transplantation to enhance the suppressor immune response as an alternative or complementary approach to reach a clinical tolerogenic state and preserve graft function. Exercise improves baseline immune function and helps to maintain immune homeostasis. Treg cell numbers have shown to increase with physical activity, and this increment has been directly correlated with exercise intensity. These results suggest that the increased Treg frequency may contribute to the beneficial effects of exercise on disorders associated with autoimmune disease or chronic low-grade inflammation such as atherosclerosis, diabetes mellitus, chronic kidney disease or cancer.

Primary Objectives: The overall purpose of this study is to determine the influence High-intensity interval training (HIIT) on the frequency and quality of peripheral Treg cells.

Secondary Objectives: Effects of HIIT in other T cell populations. Effects of HIIT in plasma concentration of inflammatory and metabolic markers. Effects of HIIT in obese vs lean.

Design: This is a prospective, single center, single-arm ""pre-test/post-test"" study designed to evaluate the safety, feasibility and initial efficacy of a 12-week HIIT regimen to increase the frequency and quality of peripheral Treg cells.
