The iC9.CAR.B7-H3 treatment is experimental and has not been approved by the Food and Drug Administration.,"This is a phase 1, single-center, open-label study to determine the safety of escalating doses of chimeric antigen receptor T cells (CAR-T) cells targeting the B7-H3 antigen and containing the inducible caspase 9 safety switch (iC9-CAR.B7-H3 T cells) administered to adult subjects with refractory pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma. The safety of iC9-CAR.B7-H3 T cells will be investigated using a modified 3+3 design with a starting dose of 1 × 106 transduced cells/kg. The data from the dose escalation will be used to determine a recommended phase 2 dose, which will be decided based on the maximum tolerated dose and additional factors such as the ability to manufacture sufficient cells for infusion.

The body has different ways of fighting cancer and other diseases; however, no single way seems perfect. The experimental treatment in this study combines two different ways the body fights cancer, and they are antibodies and T cells. Antibodies are proteins that protect the body from foreign invaders like bacteria. Antibodies work by attaching to these bacteria or substances, which stops them from growing and causing bad effects. T cells are special infection-fighting blood cells that can kill viruses and other cells, including tumor cells. Antibodies and T cells have been used to treat patients with cancer. They both have shown promise, but neither alone has been able to cure most patients. The treatment that is being studied in this study is called autologous T lymphocyte chimeric antigen receptor cells targeted against the B7-H3 antigen and containing inducible caspase 9 safety switch (iC9).

The antigen B7-H3 is highly expressed in glioblastoma of a subset of patients. B7-H3 CAR-T, made from isolated patient peripheral blood mononuclear cells, can specifically attack patient glioblastoma cells that expressing B7-H3.","Background

* B7-H3 is expressed in 70% of patients with glioblastoma
* B7-H3 is not expressed in normal tissues especially not in central nervous system. Therefore, it is an attractive GBM target for CAR-T therapy
* The investigators constructed a retroviral vector encoding a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) targeting B7-H3, which can mediate CAR transfer into patient T cells with high efficiency.

Objectives

* To evaluate the safety and tolerability intratumoral/intracerebroventricular injection of B7-H3 CAR-T when used in between Temozolomide cycles
* To compare the overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) of R/R GBM patients treated with B7-H3 CAR-T in between Temozolomide cycles to the historical Temozolomide data
* To access the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of B7-H3 CAR-T in between Temozolomide cycles

Design

Patients autologous T cells are activated and transduced with retrovirus containing B7-H3 CAR. CAR-T cells are expanded ex vivo and infused back to patients via intratumoral or intracerebroventricular injection through an Ommaya catheter. 3 injections of CAR-T are planned at two different doses with 1-2 weeks intervals. The CAR-T injections occur in between Temozolomide (TMZ) cycles. Temozolomide treatment in the cycle of CAR-T injections will be stopped and resumed next cycle.

The antigen B7-H3 is highly expressed in glioblastoma of a subset of patients. B7-H3 CAR-T, made from isolated patient peripheral blood mononuclear cells, can specifically attack patient glioblastoma cells that expressing B7-H3.","Background

* B7-H3 is expressed in 70% of patients with glioblastoma
* B7-H3 is not expressed in normal tissues especially not in central nervous system. Therefore, it is an attractive GBM target for CAR-T therapy
* The investigators constructed a retroviral vector encoding a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) targeting B7-H3, which can mediate CAR transfer into patient T cells with high efficiency.

Objectives

* To evaluate the safety and tolerability intratumoral/intracerebroventricular injection of B7-H3 CAR-T when used in between Temozolomide cycles
* To compare the overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) of R/R GBM patients treated with B7-H3 CAR-T in between Temozolomide cycles vs Temozolomide alone
* To access the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of B7-H3 CAR-T in between Temozolomide cycles

Design

* Experimental group: Patients autologous T cells are activated and transduced with retrovirus containing B7-H3 CAR. CAR-T cells are expanded ex vivo and infused back to patients via intratumoral or intracerebroventricular injection through an Ommaya catheter. 3 injections of CAR-T are planned at two different doses with 1-2 weeks intervals. The CAR-T injections occur in between Temozolomide (TMZ) cycles. Temozolomide treatment during the cycles of CAR-T injections will be stopped and resumed next cycle. Patients may receive additional CAR-T cycles at the discretion of the principal investigator and oncologist.

The B7-H3 protein is found in high levels on many pediatric solid tumors (like neuroblastoma, osteosarcoma, and others), this cell therapy uses genetically altered blood cells as an investigational cell product designed to recognize, bind to and help kill cells that express B7-H3.

This is the first time that these specific B7-H3 CAR T cells will be given to humans. There are several other studies using a similar genetically modified version of B7-H3 CAR T cells and other studies have shown that B7-H3 is a safe target.

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has not approved B7-H3 CAR T cells as a treatment for any disease.

The dose escalation phase is designed to characterize the safety and tolerability of MGD009 and to define the maximum tolerated or maximum administered dose (MTD/MAD). This phase will enroll patients with mesothelioma, bladder cancer, melanoma, squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN), non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC), ovarian cancer, thyroid cancer, triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), pancreatic cancer, colon cancer, soft tissue sarcoma, or prostate cancer.

In the cohort expansion phase, 6 cohorts of 16 patients each will be enrolled to further evaluate the safety and potential efficacy of MGD009 administered at the MTD/MAD dose in patients with mesothelioma, bladder cancer, melanoma, SCCHN, NSCLC, or other specific tumors that express high levels of B7-H3. Pre- and on-study biopsies are required for melanoma patients in the cohort expansion phase. Two additional cohorts (up to15 patients each) will evaluate the use of prophylaxis therapies to mitigate toxicity.

The investigators are attempting to use T cells obtained directly from the patient, which can be genetically modified to express a 4th generation CD276-specific chimeric antigen receptor (4SCAR-276).

1. Participants will be screened through physical exam and medical history. Blood and tumor tissue samples will be collected. Imaging studies will be performed.
2. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) will be obtained by apheresis, and T cells will be activated and modified to express the 4SCAR-276 gene.
3. On Day -5 to -7, PBMC will be activated and enriched for T cells, which will be followed by 4SCAR-276 lentiviral transduction. The total culture time is approximately 5-7 days.
4. Participants will receive a preparative conditioning regimen comprising cyclophosphamide/fludarabine to prepare their immune system to accept the modified CAR T cells.

B7-H3-CAR T cells will be locoregionally administered via a CNS reservoir catheter. Study participants will be divided into two cohorts: cohort A with B7-H3-positive relapsed/refractory non-brainstem primary CNS tumors, and cohort B with diffuse midline gliomas (DMG). Participants will receive four (4) B7-H3-CAR T cell infusions over a 4 week period. The purpose of this study is to find the maximum (highest) dose of B7-H3-CAR T cells that are safe to give patients with primary brain tumors.

Primary objectives

* To determine the safety, maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) for the locoregional delivery of autologous B7-H3-CAR T cells in patients ≤ 21 years of age with recurrent/refractory B7-H3+ primary CNS tumors (Cohort A) or DMG (Cohort B).

Secondary objectives

* To assess the efficacy, defined as sustained objective response, a partial response (PR) or complete response (CR) observed anytime on active treatment with B7-H3-CAR T cells in patients with relapsed/refractory B7-H3+ primary CNS tumors (Cohort A) or DMG (Cohort B).
* To characterize and monitor neurologic toxicities in patients while on study (Cohort A and B).",Treatment on this study includes four (4) B7-H3-CAR T cell infusions over a 4 week period. B7-H3-CAR T cells will be locoregionally administered via a CNS reservoir catheter without lymphodepleting chemotherapy. The study will evaluate the safety and maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of B7-H3-CAR T cells using a 3+3 study design and a 4 week evaluation period.

An expansion cohort will enroll additional subjects at the RP2D for a total enrollment of up to 21 subjects on the protocol.","This study is intended for the patients who have been diagnosed with Epithelial Ovarian Cancer that either came back or did not improve after previous treatments. The purpose of this study is to test the safety of using a new treatment called autologous T lymphocyte chimeric antigen receptor cells against the B7-H3 antigen (CAR.B7-H3 T cells) in patients with ovarian cancer. This treatment has not been approved by the Food and Drug Administration.

The study investigator's goal is to calculate the Maximum tolerated dose of the CAR.B7-H3 cells There are two parts to this study. In part 1, subject's blood sample will be used to manufacture the CAR.B7-H3 T cells.

Ovarian cancer cells carry a substance called B7-H3 which is not found in other healthy cells. the subject's T cells will be modified to make CAR.B7-H3 T cells so they may attack and destroy ovarian cancer cells that carry the B7-H3 substance. The CAR.B7-H3 T cells are given through a catheter in the abdomen, after completing three rounds of lymphodepletion chemotherapy. Lymphodepletion chemotherapy prepares the body to receive the CAR.B7-H3 T cells.

In part 2 of the study, the subjects will receive the CAR.B7-H3 T cells. Eligible patients will receive lymphodepletion chemotherapy with cyclophosphamide and fludarabine for three consecutive days. If they continue to meet the eligibility criteria, the modified CAR.B7-H3 T cells will be given to them 2-14 days after the last lymphodepletion chemotherapy session. Three infusions of the CAR.B7-H3 T cells may be given to the subject through a catheter in the abdomen. Infusions will be done once a week.

Lymphodepletion chemotherapy and infusion of the CAR.B7-H3 T cells will happen at UNC Cancer Hospital. On the days the subjects receive the CAR.B7-H3 T cells infusion- Blood, fluid, and tumor samples will be collected from the subject for research purposes. Tumor biopsies are a mandatory part of this research.

Post infusion visits are - 3, 4, and 6 weeks. Additional visits will happen every 3 months for one year after the last infusion. Similar follow-up clinic visits will be completed annually, for a total of 5 years.

Patients will be enrolled to one of three planned dose levels with B7-H3 CAR T cell dose determined based on the percentage of B7-H3 transduced cells (B7-H3+ population of cells), and dTBRII-transduced PRAME TA-specific T cell dose based on the total cell population. Both doses will be based on the recipient's body weight.

The safety of the CAR-TA T cell product will be evaluated and the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) will be determined. The safety endpoint will be assessed by monitoring for dose limiting toxicities for 28 days following CAR-TA T cell administration.","This protocol is designed as a phase I dose-escalation study. Procurement phase: During the procurement phase of this protocol, upon SABRE Procurement Consent and procurement eligibility confirmation, participants will undergo a non-mobilized apheresis for collection of mononuclear cells to be used for the CAR-TA T cell product manufacturing.

Treatment phase: Once the CAR-TA T cell products are released and patients are confirmed eligible for CAR-TA T cell product infusion, participants will undergo protocol therapy at Children's National Hospital, consisting of a standard Lymphodepleting chemotherapy preparative regimen with fludarabine and cyclophosphamide, followed by intravenous infusion of the combined CAR-TA T cell product. The DNR-TA T cells and B7-H3 CAR T cells will be generated and combined into a final product comprised of the two T cell components combined at a 1:1 ratio. Patients will be enrolled to one of three CAR-TA T cell product dose levels (dose levels 1, 2 and 3). There are provisions in place to dose de-escalate for safety concerns (dose level -1).

Fludarabine will be administered intravenously once daily over 30 minutes, days -5 through -2 (4 doses in total). The dose of fludarabine will be 30 mg/m2 /day. Cyclophosphamide will be administered intravenously once daily over 30 minutes, days -5 and -4 (2 doses in total). The dose of cyclophosphamide will be 500 mg/m2 /day.

The first 3 patients enrolled on study will be ≥ 12 years of age at enrollment and treated at dose level 1 (1 x 10e6/kg). If no DLTs are observed in this cohort, enrollment at dose levels 2 (3 x 10e6/kg) and 3 (10 x 10e6/kg) will expand to include patients aged ≥ 1 year and \< 24 years.

Patients will remain admitted for at least 7 days following the CAR-TA T cell infusion. All infused patients will be followed with weekly visits during the 28-day dose-limiting toxicity monitoring period where they will be clinically assessed, and safety and research blood draws will be performed.

Ideally, patients should not receive other systemic or local cancer-directed therapies for at least 28 days after the CAR-TA T cell infusion.

Participants will be followed closely for 1 year following the CAR-TA T-cell infusion. After 1 year, yearly assessments will be done up to 15 years. The visits will consist of labs and examinations as well as talking to participants about how they are feeling. Participants will be followed for toxicity until the last follow-up post CAR-TA T cell product administration.

This study will be conducted at Children's National Hospital (CNH). Cell culture manipulations will be carried out in the CETI Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) facility within Children's National Hospital using current standard operating procedures (SOPs).

Secondary research purpose： Evaluate the expansion and persistence of gdT cells targeting B7-H3 chimeric antigen receptor after UTAA06 injection administration in vivo; Evaluate the efficacy of UTAA06 injection in the treatment of patients with relapsed/refractory acute myeloid leukemia; Evaluate the content of B7-H3 positive cells in the peripheral blood after administration of UTAA06 injection; Evaluate the immunogenicity of UTAA06 injection.","This study is a single arm, open label, dose increasing study to explore the characteristics of drug safety, tolerance and cell kinetics, and preliminarily observe the efficacy of the study drug in patients with relapsed/refractory B7-H3 positive acute myeloid leukemia, so as to explore the formal clinical appropriate dose.

After the subjects who signed the informed consent form were screened by the inclusion/exclusion criteria, the qualified subjects will enter 1.0 in order of priority × 108，3.0 × 108 and 6.0 × 108 CAR gdT groups were administered once. The ""3+3"" design was adopted in the dose increasing study, that is, 3-6 subjects in each group completed a single dose.

After the last subject in each dose group completed the dose limiting toxicity (DLT) assessment window 28 days after the single administration, the next dose group can be started after the Safety Monitoring Committee (SRC) agrees to enter the next dose group based on the evaluation of clinical safety data.

When 1 DLT occurs in 3 subjects in a certain dose group, 3 subjects need to be added in the same dose group (up to 6 subjects in this dose group complete DLT evaluation): if the added 3 subjects have no DLT, the dose will continue to increase; If one of the three additional subjects has DLT, stop the dose increase; If more than one of the three additional subjects has DLT, stop the dose increase, and at the same time, reduce one dose to continue the DLT evaluation of the three subjects.

The SRC can decide whether to increase or decrease the dose groups or adjust the dose of groups according to the pharmacokinetic results obtained during the study.",NA,SINGLE_GROUP,UTAA06 injection,NONE,,TREATMENT,,18,ESTIMATED,,PHASE1,INTERVENTIONAL,,"Inclusion Criteria:
