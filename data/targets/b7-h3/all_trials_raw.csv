   2. Prior Therapy Wash-out: At least 2 weeks or 5 half-lives, whichever is shorter, must have elapsed since any prior systemic therapy at the time the subject is planned for leukapheresis, except for systemic inhibitory/stimulatory immune checkpoint therapy, which requires 5 half-lives. Radiation therapy must have been completed at least 3 weeks prior to enrollment, with the exception that there is no time restriction if the subject has measurable/evaluable disease outside the radiation port or the site of radiation has documented progression.
7. Normal Organ and Marrow Function (supportive care is allowed per institutional standards, i.e. filgrastim, transfusion)

   * ANC ≥ 750/uL\*
   * Platelet count ≥ 75,000/uL\*

   * Serum ALT/AST ≤ 2.5x ULN (unless elevated ALT/AST is associated with disease involvement of the liver, in which case this criterion will be waived and not disqualify a patient).
   * Total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 mg/dl, except in subjects with Gilbert's syndrome.

     * Cardiac ejection fraction ≥ 45%, no evidence of physiologically significant pericardial effusion as determined by an ECHO,
     * No clinically significant ECG findings
     * No clinically significant pleural effusion
     * Baseline oxygen saturation \> 92% on room air

       * if cytopenias are not judged by the investigator to be due to underlying disease (i.e. potentially reversible with anti-neoplastic therapy); A subject will not be excluded because of pancytopenia ≥ Grade 3 if it is due to disease, based on the results of bone marrow studies.
8. Females of childbearing potential must have a negative serum or urine pregnancy test (females who have undergone surgical sterilization or who have been postmenopausal for at least 2 years are not considered to be of childbearing potential).
9. Subjects of child-bearing or child-fathering potential must be willing to practice birth control from the time of enrollment on this study and for four (4) months after receiving the preparative regimen or for as long as CART cells are detectable in peripheral blood.
10. Must provide informed consent. For subjects \<18 years old, or adults with limited decision-making capacity, their legal authorized representative (LAR) (i.e. parent or guardian) must give informed consent. Pediatric subjects will be included in age appropriate discussion and assent will be obtained for those \> 7 years of age, when appropriate. If a minor becomes of age during participation of this study, he/she will be asked to reconsent as an adult.

Exclusion Criteria:

1. Receiving any other current investigational agents.
2. History of other malignancy, except non-melanoma skin cancer or carcinoma in situ (e.g. cervix, bladder, breast), unless disease free for at least 3 years.
3. Presence of untreated brain metastases will be excluded. Subjects with previous CNS tumor involvement that has been treated and is stable for at least 3 months following completion of therapy are permitted. Patients who are clinically stable as evidenced by no requirements for corticosteroids, no evolving neurologic deficits, and no progression of residual brain abnormalities without specific therapy, are permitted.
4. Presence of fungal, bacterial, viral, or other infection that is uncontrolled. Simple UTI and uncomplicated bacterial pharyngitis are permitted if responding to active treatment.
5. Ongoing infection with HIV or hepatitis B (HBsAg positive) or hepatitis C virus (anti HCV positive) as the immunosuppression contained in this study will pose unacceptable risk. A history of hepatitis B or hepatitis C is permitted if the viral load is undetectable per quantitative PCR and/or nucleic acid testing.
6. History of myocardial infarction, cardiac angioplasty or stenting, unstable angina, or other clinically significant cardiac disease within 12 months of enrollment.
7. Any medical condition that in the judgement of the sponsor investigator is likely to interfere with assessment of safety or efficacy of study treatment.
8. History of severe immediate hypersensitivity reaction to any of the agents used in this study.
9. Pregnant females are excluded from this study because the effects of autologous B7-H3CART on the developing human fetus are unknown and because the chemotherapy agents used in this trial (cyclophosphamide and fludarabine) are category D agents with the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Additionally, because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events (AEs) in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with cyclophosphamide/fludarabine, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated with cyclophosphamide/fludarabine. These potential risks may also apply to other agents used in this study.
10. Primary immunodeficiency or history of systemic autoimmune disease (e.g., Crohns, rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus) requiring systemic immunosuppression/systemic disease modifying agents within the last 2 years.
11. Patients who require systemic corticosteroid or other immunosuppressive therapy. (A one-week washout from systemic corticosteroid or other immunosuppressive therapy is permitted.) Use of physiologic doses of corticosteroids (up to 3 mg/m2/day prednisone equivalent) are permitted. Use of topical, ocular, intra-articular, intra-nasal, or inhaled corticosteroids are permitted.

The antigen B7-H3 is highly expressed in glioblastoma of a subset of patients. B7-H3 CAR-T, made from isolated patient peripheral blood mononuclear cells, can specifically attack patient glioblastoma cells that expressing B7-H3.","Background

* B7-H3 is expressed in 70% of patients with glioblastoma
* B7-H3 is not expressed in normal tissues especially not in central nervous system. Therefore, it is an attractive GBM target for CAR-T therapy
* The investigators constructed a retroviral vector encoding a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) targeting B7-H3, which can mediate CAR transfer into patient T cells with high efficiency.

Objectives

* To evaluate the safety and tolerability intratumoral/intracerebroventricular injection of B7-H3 CAR-T when used in between Temozolomide cycles
* To compare the overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) of R/R GBM patients treated with B7-H3 CAR-T in between Temozolomide cycles vs Temozolomide alone
* To access the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of B7-H3 CAR-T in between Temozolomide cycles

Design

* Experimental group: Patients autologous T cells are activated and transduced with retrovirus containing B7-H3 CAR. CAR-T cells are expanded ex vivo and infused back to patients via intratumoral or intracerebroventricular injection through an Ommaya catheter. 3 injections of CAR-T are planned at two different doses with 1-2 weeks intervals. The CAR-T injections occur in between Temozolomide (TMZ) cycles. Temozolomide treatment during the cycles of CAR-T injections will be stopped and resumed next cycle. Patients may receive additional CAR-T cycles at the discretion of the principal investigator and oncologist.

The B7-H3 protein is found in high levels on many pediatric solid tumors (like neuroblastoma, osteosarcoma, and others), this cell therapy uses genetically altered blood cells as an investigational cell product designed to recognize, bind to and help kill cells that express B7-H3.

This is the first time that these specific B7-H3 CAR T cells will be given to humans. There are several other studies using a similar genetically modified version of B7-H3 CAR T cells and other studies have shown that B7-H3 is a safe target.

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has not approved B7-H3 CAR T cells as a treatment for any disease.

The research study procedures include screening for eligibility, in-clinic visits, blood tests, urine tests, electrocardiograms (ECGs), echocardiograms (ECHOs), bone marrow biopsies and aspirations.

The iC9.CAR.B7-H3 treatment is experimental and has not been approved by the Food and Drug Administration.,"This is a phase 1, single-center, open-label study to determine the safety of escalating doses of chimeric antigen receptor T cells (CAR-T) cells targeting the B7-H3 antigen and containing the inducible caspase 9 safety switch (iC9-CAR.B7-H3 T cells) administered to adult subjects with refractory pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma. The safety of iC9-CAR.B7-H3 T cells will be investigated using a modified 3+3 design with a starting dose of 1 × 106 transduced cells/kg. The data from the dose escalation will be used to determine a recommended phase 2 dose, which will be decided based on the maximum tolerated dose and additional factors such as the ability to manufacture sufficient cells for infusion.

The body has different ways of fighting cancer and other diseases; however, no single way seems perfect. The experimental treatment in this study combines two different ways the body fights cancer, and they are antibodies and T cells. Antibodies are proteins that protect the body from foreign invaders like bacteria. Antibodies work by attaching to these bacteria or substances, which stops them from growing and causing bad effects. T cells are special infection-fighting blood cells that can kill viruses and other cells, including tumor cells. Antibodies and T cells have been used to treat patients with cancer. They both have shown promise, but neither alone has been able to cure most patients. The treatment that is being studied in this study is called autologous T lymphocyte chimeric antigen receptor cells targeted against the B7-H3 antigen and containing inducible caspase 9 safety switch (iC9). The short name for this treatment is iC9.CAR.B7-H3 T cells.

* B7-H3 is expressed in 70% of patients with glioblastoma
* B7-H3 is not expressed in normal tissues especially not in central nervous system. Therefore, it is an attractive GBM target for CAR-T therapy
* The investigators constructed a retroviral vector encoding a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) targeting B7-H3, which can mediate CAR transfer into patient T cells with high efficiency.

Objectives

* To evaluate the safety and tolerability intratumoral/intracerebroventricular injection of B7-H3 CAR-T when used in between Temozolomide cycles
* To compare the overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) of R/R GBM patients treated with B7-H3 CAR-T in between Temozolomide cycles to the historical Temozolomide data
* To access the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of B7-H3 CAR-T in between Temozolomide cycles

Design

Patients autologous T cells are activated and transduced with retrovirus containing B7-H3 CAR. CAR-T cells are expanded ex vivo and infused back to patients via intratumoral or intracerebroventricular injection through an Ommaya catheter. 3 injections of CAR-T are planned at two different doses with 1-2 weeks intervals.

The investigators are attempting to use T cells obtained directly from the patient, which can be genetically modified to express a 4th generation CD276-specific chimeric antigen receptor (4SCAR-276). The CAR molecules enable the T cells to recognize and kill tumor cells through the recognition of the surface CD276, which is expressed at high levels on tumor cells including brain tumors, Ewing's sarcoma (PNET) and many other tumors but not at significant levels on normal tissues. This study will evaluate the side effects and the best dose of a novel 4th generation anti-CD276 CAR T cells to target refractory and/or recurrent solid tumors.

Design:

1. Participants will be screened through physical exam and medical history. Blood and tumor tissue samples will be collected. Imaging studies will be performed.
2. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) will be obtained by apheresis, and T cells will be activated and modified to express the 4SCAR-276 gene.
3. On Day -5 to -7, PBMC will be activated and enriched for T cells, which will be followed by 4SCAR-276 lentiviral transduction. The total culture time is approximately 5-7 days.
4. Participants will receive a preparative conditioning regimen comprising cyclophosphamide/fludarabine to prepare their immune system to accept the modified CAR T cells. The preparative regimen will be based on patient immune condition and consistent with standard chemotherapy conditioning regimen.

The study will contain two-part eligibility criterion: one to proceed with autologous apheresis and manufacturing of CAR T cells, and a second to proceed with CAR T cell treatment.

The primary intervention is the administration of autologous B7-H3-CAR T cells, after priming with HFRT and administration of lymphodepleting chemotherapy. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) will be collected by autologous apheresis. Treatment will include HFRT to at least one site of disease, administered in parallel with a single course of lymphodepleting chemotherapy (fludarabine/cyclophosphamide) and followed by CAR T cell infusion. Participants are evaluated for a post-treatment tumor biopsy and may choose to be evaluated for a pre-treatment tumor biopsy.

This study will evaluate the side effects and effective doses of 4SCAR-276 in treating refractory and/or recurrent tumors.","Background: Patients with refractory and/or recurrent solid tumors have poor prognosis despite complex multimodal therapy; therefore, novel curative approaches are needed. The investigators are attempting to use T cells obtained directly from the patient, which can be genetically modified to express a 4th generation CD276-specific chimeric antigen receptor (4SCAR-276). The CAR molecules enable the T cells to recognize and kill tumor cells through the recognition of the surface CD276, which is expressed at high levels on tumor cells including brain tumors, Ewing's sarcoma (PNET) and many other tumors but not at significant levels on normal tissues. This study will evaluate the side effects and the best dose of a novel 4th generation anti-CD276 CAR T cells to target refractory and/or recurrent solid tumors.

Design:

1. Participants will be screened through physical exam and medical history. Blood and tumor tissue samples will be collected. Imaging studies will be performed.
2. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) will be obtained by apheresis, and T cells will be activated and modified to express the 4SCAR-276 gene.
3. On Day -5 to -7, PBMC will be activated and enriched for T cells, which will be followed by 4SCAR-276 lentiviral transduction. The total culture time is approximately 5-7 days.
4. Participants will receive a preparative conditioning regimen comprising cyclophosphamide/fludarabine to prepare their immune system to accept the modified CAR T cells. The preparative regimen will be based on patient immune condition and consistent with standard chemotherapy conditioning regimen.
5. The patients will receive \~10\^6 CART cells/kg body weight per infusion, and may receive additional booster CART infusions if positive outcome is recorded.",,,NA,SINGLE_GROUP,,NONE,,,TREATMENT,,100,ESTIMATED,,,"PHASE1, PHASE2",INTERVENTIONAL,,,"Inclusion Criteria:

The study consists of a Dose Escalation Phase to determine the MTD (or MAD) of enoblituzumab followed by a Cohort Expansion Phase to further define the safety and initial antitumor activity of enoblituzumab. In the cohort expansion phase, 5 cohorts of 10 patients each will be enrolled to further evaluate the safety and potential efficacy of enoblituzumab administered at the MTD/MAD in patients with:1) neuroblastoma - measurable disease, 2) neuroblastoma - non-measurable disease, 3) rhabdomyosarcoma, 4) osteosarcoma, and 5) Ewing's sarcoma, Wilms' tumor, desmoplastic small round cell tumors, or malignant solid tumors of any other histology that test positive for B7-H3.

All tumor evaluations will be carried out by both Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) and immune-related response criteria (irRC).

An expansion cohort will enroll additional subjects at the RP2D for a total enrollment of up to 21 subjects on the protocol.","This study is intended for the patients who have been diagnosed with Epithelial Ovarian Cancer that either came back or did not improve after previous treatments. The purpose of this study is to test the safety of using a new treatment called autologous T lymphocyte chimeric antigen receptor cells against the B7-H3 antigen (CAR.B7-H3 T cells) in patients with ovarian cancer. This treatment has not been approved by the Food and Drug Administration.

The study investigator's goal is to calculate the Maximum tolerated dose of the CAR.B7-H3 cells There are two parts to this study. In part 1, subject's blood sample will be used to manufacture the CAR.B7-H3 T cells.

Ovarian cancer cells carry a substance called B7-H3 which is not found in other healthy cells. the subject's T cells will be modified to make CAR.B7-H3 T cells so they may attack and destroy ovarian cancer cells that carry the B7-H3 substance. The CAR.B7-H3 T cells are given through a catheter in the abdomen, after completing three rounds of lymphodepletion chemotherapy. Lymphodepletion chemotherapy prepares the body to receive the CAR.B7-H3 T cells.

In part 2 of the study, the subjects will receive the CAR.B7-H3 T cells. Eligible patients will receive lymphodepletion chemotherapy with cyclophosphamide and fludarabine for three consecutive days. If they continue to meet the eligibility criteria, the modified CAR.B7-H3 T cells will be given to them 2-14 days after the last lymphodepletion chemotherapy session. Three infusions of the CAR.B7-H3 T cells may be given to the subject through a catheter in the abdomen. Infusions will be done once a week.

Lymphodepletion chemotherapy and infusion of the CAR.B7-H3 T cells will happen at UNC Cancer Hospital. On the days the subjects receive the CAR.B7-H3 T cells infusion- Blood, fluid, and tumor samples will be collected from the subject for research purposes. Tumor biopsies are a mandatory part of this research.

Post infusion visits are - 3, 4, and 6 weeks. Additional visits will happen every 3 months for one year after the last infusion. Similar follow-up clinic visits will be completed annually, for a total of 5 years.

of this study is to evaluate the safety of MGD009 when given to patients with B7-H3-expressing tumors. The study will also evaluate what is the highest dose of MGD009 that can be given safely. Assessments will be done to see how the drug acts in the body (pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics (PD) and to evaluate potential anti-tumor activity of MGD009.","This study is a Phase 1 open-label, dose escalation, cohort expansion, and efficacy follow-up study of MGD009 administered intravenously (IV) on an every-other-week schedule for up to one year (14 cycles).

The dose escalation phase is designed to characterize the safety and tolerability of MGD009 and to define the maximum tolerated or maximum administered dose (MTD/MAD). This phase will enroll patients with mesothelioma, bladder cancer, melanoma, squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN), non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC), ovarian cancer, thyroid cancer, triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), pancreatic cancer, colon cancer, soft tissue sarcoma, or prostate cancer.

In the cohort expansion phase, 6 cohorts of 16 patients each will be enrolled to further evaluate the safety and potential efficacy of MGD009 administered at the MTD/MAD dose in patients with mesothelioma, bladder cancer, melanoma, SCCHN, NSCLC, or other specific tumors that express high levels of B7-H3. Pre- and on-study biopsies are required for melanoma patients in the cohort expansion phase. Two additional cohorts (up to15 patients each) will evaluate the use of prophylaxis therapies to mitigate toxicity.

The survival follow-up phase consists of the 2-year period after the final dose of study drug.

Patients will be enrolled to one of three planned dose levels with B7-H3 CAR T cell dose determined based on the percentage of B7-H3 transduced cells (B7-H3+ population of cells), and dTBRII-transduced PRAME TA-specific T cell dose based on the total cell population. Both doses will be based on the recipient's body weight.

The safety of the CAR-TA T cell product will be evaluated and the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) will be determined. The safety endpoint will be assessed by monitoring for dose limiting toxicities for 28 days following CAR-TA T cell administration.","This protocol is designed as a phase I dose-escalation study. Procurement phase: During the procurement phase of this protocol, upon SABRE Procurement Consent and procurement eligibility confirmation, participants will undergo a non-mobilized apheresis for collection of mononuclear cells to be used for the CAR-TA T cell product manufacturing.

Treatment phase: Once the CAR-TA T cell products are released and patients are confirmed eligible for CAR-TA T cell product infusion, participants will undergo protocol therapy at Children's National Hospital, consisting of a standard Lymphodepleting chemotherapy preparative regimen with fludarabine and cyclophosphamide, followed by intravenous infusion of the combined CAR-TA T cell product. The DNR-TA T cells and B7-H3 CAR T cells will be generated and combined into a final product comprised of the two T cell components combined at a 1:1 ratio. Patients will be enrolled to one of three CAR-TA T cell product dose levels (dose levels 1, 2 and 3). There are provisions in place to dose de-escalate for safety concerns (dose level -1).

Fludarabine will be administered intravenously once daily over 30 minutes, days -5 through -2 (4 doses in total). The dose of fludarabine will be 30 mg/m2 /day. Cyclophosphamide will be administered intravenously once daily over 30 minutes, days -5 and -4 (2 doses in total). The dose of cyclophosphamide will be 500 mg/m2 /day.

The first 3 patients enrolled on study will be ≥ 12 years of age at enrollment and treated at dose level 1 (1 x 10e6/kg). If no DLTs are observed in this cohort, enrollment at dose levels 2 (3 x 10e6/kg) and 3 (10 x 10e6/kg) will expand to include patients aged ≥ 1 year and \< 24 years.

Patients will remain admitted for at least 7 days following the CAR-TA T cell infusion. All infused patients will be followed with weekly visits during the 28-day dose-limiting toxicity monitoring period where they will be clinically assessed, and safety and research blood draws will be performed.

Ideally, patients should not receive other systemic or local cancer-directed therapies for at least 28 days after the CAR-TA T cell infusion.

Participants will be followed closely for 1 year following the CAR-TA T-cell infusion. After 1 year, yearly assessments will be done up to 15 years. The visits will consist of labs and examinations as well as talking to participants about how they are feeling. Participants will be followed for toxicity until the last follow-up post CAR-TA T cell product administration.

This study will be conducted at Children's National Hospital (CNH). Cell culture manipulations will be carried out in the CETI Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) facility within Children's National Hospital using current standard operating procedures (SOPs).

According to the results of the CONKO-005 clinical trial, compared with the single-agent Gemcitabine (Gemcitabine) treatment, the combined use of Erlotinib (Erolotinib) did not prolong the survival time of pancreatic cancer patients in postoperative adjuvant treatment. However, another phase III clinical result for patients with advanced pancreatic cancer found that compared with gemcitabine monotherapy, the survival of patients in the combined gemcitabine and erlotinib treatment group was significantly improved (6.24 months VS 5.91 months). The one-year survival rate has also improved (23% VS 17%). As a result, the FDA approved the ""gemcitabine + erlotinib"" combination regimen in 2005 for patients with locally advanced unresectable pancreatic cancer or distant metastases. However, this program only improves survival for about 10 days, making it difficult for the targeted drug erlotinib to achieve greater clinical benefit in the treatment of pancreatic cancer.

The trial will consist of a Phase 0 component (subdivided into Arms A and B) and an Expansion Phase 1 component. Participants with tumors demonstrating a positive pharmacokinetic (PK) response in the Phase 0 component will be eligible to enroll in the Expansion Phase to receive therapeutic dosing of risvutatug rezetecan.","Phase 0:

Patients with rGBM will enroll into Arm A. Arm A Cohort 1 will determine the optimal time interval (OTI) for surgery based on PK data assessed from two sub-cohorts (Cohort 1a and 1b). The OTI will be defined as the surgical time interval after dosing that corresponds to the highest median concentration of unbound risvutatug rezetecan payload in gadolinium (Gd) non enhancing rGBM tissue in either Cohort 1a or Cohort 1b.

Arm A Cohort 2 will receive the IV infusion at the OTI schedule. Cohort 2 enrollment will begin once Arm A Cohort 1 enrollment is complete and the OTI has been determined.

Patients with brain metastases will enroll into Arm B. Arm B will receive the IV infusion at the OTI schedule. Arm B enrollment will begin once Arm A Cohort 1 enrollment is complete and the OTI has been determined.

After enrollment into Cohort 1 is complete, a written report will be submitted to the DSMB Chair (or qualified alternate) describing the time intervals, adverse events (AE) observed, and any safety reports. The DSMB Chair will review the report and provide written authorization to proceed with Arm A Cohort 2 and Arm B enrollment, or request more information within approximately two business days.

Approval for enrollment initiation must be obtained prior to opening enrollment for Arm A Cohort 2 and Arm B.

Only participants with tumors demonstrating positive PK response will proceed to the expansion Phase 1 component. Otherwise, participants will receive standard of care.

Participants will complete the assessments and procedures noted for the End of Treatment (EOT) Visit. Participants will complete the 30-Day, 60-Day, and 90-Day Safety Follow-Up Visits and they will be monitored for survival as outlined in the ""All Participants"" section.

To assess the PK and pharmacodynamic (PD) endpoints, blood, serum, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and brain tumor tissue will be collected intraoperatively (Gd enhancing and Gd non-enhancing tumor tissue will be collected and analyzed separately).

Phase 1:

Participants with tumors demonstrating positive PK response will continue risvutatug rezetecan treatment at the same dose received in Phase 0, administered once every three weeks (Q3W). Treatment will begin once the participant has recovered from surgery. Participants will receive risvutatug rezetecan until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, death, withdrawal of consent, loss to follow-up, or study termination by the Sponsor.

Participants will complete the assessments and procedures noted for the EOT Visit. Participants will complete the 30-day, 60-day, and 90-day Safety Follow-Up Visits and they will be monitored for survival as outlined in the ""All Participants"" section.

All Participants:

All participants will return to the clinic for safety monitoring per the schedule of activities following risvutatug rezetecan treatment discontinuation, and will be contacted approximately every 3 months for up to 12 months for survival data collection.

Follow-up for long-term survival will begin after the final safety follow-up visit. MRI scans and RANO reviews will occur approximately every 2-3 months, per standard of care, to monitor disease progression.

Participant Duration:

Phase 0: The Phase 0 component will last up to approximately 2 months, starting at the 28-day screening window through the Post-Op Follow-Up Visit.

Phase 1: Participants will take risvutatug rezetecan as long as the drug is tolerated and the Investigator believes the participant may be obtaining benefit. Treatment will continue until confirmed progression, unacceptable toxicity, death, withdrawal of consent, lost to follow-up, or end of treatment.

All Participants: Participants will continue participating for 15 months following their last infusion of risvutatug rezetecan. Participants will return for a 30-day, 60-day, and 90 day Safety Follow-Up Visit. They will then be followed for survival for up to 12 months following the final Safety Follow-Up Visit.",,,NA,SINGLE_GROUP,,NONE,,,TREATMENT,,15,ESTIMATED,,,EARLY_PHASE1,INTERVENTIONAL,,,"Inclusion Criteria:

It is expressed in resting fibroblasts, endothelial cells, osteoblasts, amniotic fluid stem cells and other non-immune cells, and The surface of induced antigen-presenting cells and NK cells. Many studies have revealed that B7-H3 is overexpressed in a variety of tumors, including melanoma, pancreatic cancer, breast cancer, prostate cancer, colorectal cancer and other tumors, and its expression level is closely related to the poor prognosis and clinical outcome of patients . Preclinical studies have confirmed that the expression of CD276 mRNA in pancreatic cancer tissues is significantly higher than that of normal adjacent groups.","Traditional treatments have limited efficacy in patients with pancreatic cancer, and molecular targeted therapy also has limited benefits. According to the results of the CONKO-005 clinical trial, compared with the single-agent Gemcitabine (Gemcitabine) treatment, the combined use of Erlotinib (Erolotinib) did not prolong the survival time of pancreatic cancer patients in postoperative adjuvant treatment. However, another phase III clinical result for patients with advanced pancreatic cancer found that compared with gemcitabine monotherapy, the survival of patients in the combined gemcitabine and erlotinib treatment group was significantly improved (6.24 months VS 5.91 months). The one-year survival rate has also improved (23% VS 17%). As a result, the FDA approved the ""gemcitabine + erlotinib"" combination regimen in 2005 for patients with locally advanced unresectable pancreatic cancer or distant metastases. However, this program only improves survival for about 10 days, making it difficult for the targeted drug erlotinib to achieve greater clinical benefit in the treatment of pancreatic cancer. In February 2019, the FDA approved olapa, an inhibitor that targets poly-ADP ribose polymerase, for the maintenance treatment of patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer who carry BRCA gene mutations, and then the population of patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer who carry BRCA gene mutations The limited quantity limits the scope of clinical application of olaparib. Therefore, it is necessary to explore new anti-pancreatic cancer therapeutic targets.

CAR T cells are delivered via an indwelling catheter into the tumor resection cavity or ventricular system in children and young adults with diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (DIPG), diffuse midline glioma (DMG), and recurrent or refractory CNS tumors.

A child or young adult meeting all eligibility criteria, including having a CNS catheter placed into the tumor resection cavity or into their ventricular system, and meeting none of the exclusion criteria, will have their T cells collected. The T cells will then be bioengineered into a second-generation CAR T cell that targets B7H3-expressing tumor cells. Patients will be assigned to one of 3 treatment arms based on location or type of their tumor. Patients with supratentorial tumors will be assigned to Arm A, and will receive their treatment into the tumor cavity. Patients with either infratentorial or metastatic/leptomeningeal tumors will be assigned to Arm B, and will have their treatment delivered into the ventricular system. The first 3 patients enrolled onto the study must be at least 15 years of age and assigned to Arm A or Arm B. Patients with DIPG will be assigned to Arm C and have their treatment delivered into the ventricular system. The patient's newly engineered T cells will be administered via the indwelling catheter for two courses. In the first course patients in Arms A and B will receive a weekly dose of CAR T cells for three weeks, followed by a week off, an examination period, and then another course of weekly doses for three weeks. Patients in Arm C will receive a dose of CAR T cells every other week for 3 weeks, followed by a week off, an examination period, and then dosing every other week for 3 weeks. Following the two courses, patients in all Arms will undergo a series of studies including MRI to evaluate the effect of the CAR T cells and may have the opportunity to continue receiving additional courses of CAR T cells if the patient has not had adverse effects and if more of their T cells are available.

The hypothesis is that an adequate amount of B7H3-specific CAR T cells can be manufactured to complete two courses of treatment with 3 or 2 doses given on a weekly schedule followed by one week off in each course. The other hypothesis is that B7H3-specific CAR T cells can safely be administered through an indwelling CNS catheter or delivered directly into the brain via indwelling catheter to allow the T cells to directly interact with the tumor cells for each patient enrolled on the study. Secondary aims of the study will include evaluating CAR T cell distribution with the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), the extent to which CAR T cells egress or traffic into the peripheral circulation or blood stream, and, if tissues samples from multiple timepoints are available, also evaluate disease response to B7-H3 CAR T cell locoregional therapy.",,,,NON_RANDOMIZED,PARALLEL,,NONE,,,TREATMENT,,90,ESTIMATED,,,PHASE1,INTERVENTIONAL,,,"Inclusion Criteria:

Nevertheless, among the patients with high mutation burdens, some still remained refractory to immunotherapy. The B7 family molecules have long been perceived as vital determinant of immune response and may define dominant molecular subsets associated with immunotherapeutic response. Simultaneously, our previous study (Eur J Cancer. 2022,171:133-142) unveiled the potential of B7-H4 as a candidate biomarker to refine the predictive capability of tumor mutation burden (TMB) in immunotherapeutic efficacy based on its significant correlation with TMB in MIBC. We hypothesized that the integration of B7 family molecules with TMB could better identify patients with better response to checkpoint blockade.

In this retrospective study, a total of 1,084 UC patients from 5 independent cohorts were enrolled. We established the B7 Family Score (BFS) by the expression patterns of three B7 family members: PD-L1 (CD274), B7-H3 (CD276) and B7-H4 (VTCN1) based on protein and transcriptomic level respectively. We further investigated the correlation of BFS with genomic features and therapeutic response in UC. In addition, we integrated the BFS with tumor mutation burden (TMB) to better stratify the clinical benefit from PD-L1 blockade and platinum-based chemotherapy.","On the basis of established findings in the prognostic and functional properties of the three B7 family members, i.e., PD-L1, B7-H3, and B7-H4, we employed the IMVigor210 cohort as the discovery cohort to establish the concept of B7 Family Score (BFS). To maximize the prognostic value of the system, we introduced the R package survMisc (0.5.5) in the IMvigor210 cohort to determine the best cut-off value of mRNA expression level of the B7 family members (i.e. CD274, CD276, and VTCN1) by calculating the minimum log-rank P value accordingly.","Formalin-fixed, paraffin embedded samples have been constructed into TMA to evaluate protein expression within the tissue.",SAMPLES_WITHOUT_DNA,,,,,,COHORT,,RETROSPECTIVE,215,ACTUAL,,False,,OBSERVATIONAL,,,"Inclusion Criteria:

the cancers ability to grow and spread. This study specifically aims to evaluate how well GSK5764227 works in treating relapsed SCLC compared to standard treatment topotecan, by checking whether GSK5764227 makes cancers smaller or disappear completely and if it helps participants live longer. The study is also assessing whether GSK576227 is safe and tolerated well by participants compared to topotecan and provide a better understanding of the main side effects of both drugs. Participants with relapsed SCLC will be randomly divided into two groups: one group receiving GSK5764227 and the other receiving topotecan.""",,,,RANDOMIZED,PARALLEL,,NONE,,,TREATMENT,,300,ESTIMATED,,,PHASE3,INTERVENTIONAL,,,"Inclusion Criteria:

The study primarily focuses on determining the maximum tolerated dose and recommended phase II dose through sequential cohort dose escalation, while secondarily characterizing the pharmacokinetic parameters and collecting initial efficacy data regarding tumor response.

This investigation comprehensively evaluates the pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic profile of MT027 cellular therapy through three primary objectives: (1) systematic monitoring of treatment-emergent adverse events and clinically significant laboratory parameter deviations; (2) assessment of antitumor activity with correlative biomarker analysis; and (3) characterization of cellular kinetics including biodistribution patterns, mechanistic pathways of therapeutic activity, and comprehensive immunogenicity assessment measuring both cellular/humoral immune responses against MT027 cells. The protocol further investigates potential host-versus-product immune reactions through longitudinal monitoring of donor-specific antibodies and cytokine release profiles, while employing advanced molecular tracking methodologies to elucidate cellular persistence and functional modulation within the tumor microenvironment.","This single-arm, dose-escalation phase I clinical trial aims to assess the tolerability, safety, pharmacokinetic profile, and preliminary efficacy of MT027 in patients with advanced primary peritoneal malignancies or secondary abdominopelvic metastatic solid tumors.

This phase I study implements a tripartite dose-escalation framework (1×10⁷, 3×10⁷, and 6×10⁷ cells/administration) with biweekly intravenous dosing. Post-initial dosing requires a 4-week observation period for dose-limiting toxicities (DLT) graded per NCI-CTCAE v5.0 criteria, followed by subsequent 14-day interval administrations. Following 6 completed treatment cycles (12 weeks), participants may either transition to surveillance follow-up or continue therapy per investigator-determined risk-benefit analysis.

The hybrid accelerated titration ""3+3"" design initiates with single-patient cohorts for preliminary dose evaluation, transitioning to conventional 3+3 methodology (minimum 3 patients/cohort) for subsequent dose levels. Protocol-defined dose escalation beyond predetermined thresholds requires documented consensus between investigators and sponsors, contingent upon comprehensive review of cumulative safety parameters (including DLT absence) and emerging efficacy indicators.

The trial progresses through sequential Phase IA (dose-finding) and Phase IB (dose-expansion) stages. Phase Ia cessation triggers include either confirmation of Recommended Phase II Dose (RP2D) or investigator-verified favorable therapeutic index at any dose level.

An interim analysis will be conducted upon Phase IA completion, followed by submission of an ethical amendment application prior to initiating Phase IB. Phase IB will be initiated with multi-cohort expansion (n=9-18 per cohort) across prespecified malignancies: colorectal adenocarcinoma (CRC), gastric carcinoma (GC), high-grade serous ovarian carcinoma (HGSOC), breast cancer (BC), non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), small cell lung cancer (SCLC), metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC), clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC), and cervical squamous cell carcinoma (CSCC), etc.",,,NA,SINGLE_GROUP,Accelerated titration and 3+3 design dose escalation,NONE,,,TREATMENT,,12,ESTIMATED,,,PHASE1,INTERVENTIONAL,,,"Inclusion Criteria:

The objectives of this study are to investigate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and anti-tumor activity of ILB-3101 in Chinese advanced solid tumor patients.","This is an open-label, multi-center, dose-escalation and expansion, first-in-human phase 1 study in Chinese adult participants with locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors. This study will consist of two parts: A Part I dose escalation stage and a Part II dose expansion stage.

The objectives of this study are to evaluate the safety, tolerability, PK and preliminary anti-tumor activity, describe the dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs), and determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or maximum administered dose (MAD) of ILB-3101.

Part I: Participants with advanced cancer are eligible for dose escalation study if they have progressed on or intolerant to available standard therapies, or no standard or available curative therapy exists. The dose escalation will include an initial accelerated titration design followed by 3+3 design.

Part II: Enrollment into dose expansion will begin after identification of the MTD or MAD in Phase I. The dose expansion study will be conducted in populations with the following indications: ovarian cancer, small cell lung cancer, head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, soft tissue sarcoma (including uterine sarcoma), triple negative breast cancer, esophageal squamous cell carcinoma, prostate cancer, etc..

All patients will be carefully followed for adverse events during the study treatment and for 28 days after the last dose of study drug.

factor (VEGF) bispecific antibody, in participants with advanced/metastatic or relapsed/progressive small cell lung cancer (SCLC) and non small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).","This is a two-part study designed to evaluate and establish two safe combination dose levels (recommended Phase 2 dose \[RP2D\] and a lower/another combination dose level \[RP2D-1\]) of BNT324 with BNT327 (Part 1), to determine the optimal combination dose (dose optimization \[DO\]) in NSCLC and SCLC lead indication cohorts at the RP2D and RP2D-1, to evaluate the preliminary efficacy in selected lung cancer cohorts at the highest combination dose level (in a signal seeking Part 2), and to confirm the clinical efficacy of BNT324 in combination with BNT327 at the optimal dose level in participants with advanced lung cancer in expansion cohorts (proof-of-concept \[POC\] cohorts).

The study consists of a screening period, a treatment period, a safety follow-up period, and a long-term survival follow-up period.

In Part 1 participants with histologically or cytologically confirmed relapsed or progressive lung cancer (both SCLC and NSCLC are eligible) will receive BNT324 in combination with BNT327 using a dose escalation design.

In Part 2 of the study, BNT324 will be studied in combination with BNT327 at the RP2D compared to RP2D-1 in participants with advanced metastatic treatment-naïve NSCLC (DO Cohort 1) and relapsed/progressive SCLC after failure of cytotoxic chemotherapy with or without immuno-oncology (IO) (DO Cohort 2). The totality of the available data (e.g., safety, efficacy, pharmacokinetics etc.) will be reviewed to select the optimal dose. After the optimal dose is selected, additional participants in each cohort may be enrolled in the selected optimal dose.

In the signal seeking cohorts (Cohort 3-7), participants will receive BNT324 in combination with BNT327 at the RP2D from Part 1.

A predefined number of participants in Part 2 Cohort 1 and Cohort 2 will be randomized to one of the two dose levels (RP2D and RP2D-1) selected from Part 1 in a 1:1 ratio. Additional participants in Part 2 Cohort 1 and Cohort 2 may be enrolled in the selected optimal dose to further assess the efficacy and safety profile.

Exclusion Criteria

Participants who meet any of the following criteria will be disqualified from entering the study:

1. Has received prior treatment with orlotamab, enoblituzumab, or other B7 homologue 3 (B7-H3) targeted agents, including I-DXd.
2. Prior discontinuation of an antibody drug conjugate (ADC) that consists of an exatecan derivative (eg, trastuzumab deruxtecan) due to treatment-related toxicities.
3. Has received any of the comparators used in this study or any topoisomerase I inhibitor.
4. Has inadequate washout period before randomization as specified in the protocol.

Over the past few years, CAR-T therapy against GD2 in NB has achieved encouraging but modest outcomes. Only a fraction of patients achieved measurable responses. Like for many other solid tumors, CAR-T therapy for NB is not as effective as for hematologic malignancies.

In this study, the investigators use ""multiple targeting"" approach as the strategy to overcome the challenge in treating NB. Prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) is expressed in normal prostate but is upregulated in prostate tumor. However, PSMA expression is not restricted to prostate cancer. By immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining, the investigators confirmed that PSMA is expressed in a variety of solid tumors, including brain tumor, neuroblastoma and some lymphoma tumor tissues. Therefore, PSMA could potentially serve as a promising target for antigen-specific immunotherapy in patients with NB. In addition, CD276 (B7-H3) is an immune checkpoint molecule highly expressed on many solid tumors including NB. CD276 has been characterized to be involved in tumor evasion and thus its expression is correlated with poor prognosis. These characteristics make CD276 an attractive candidate for immunotherapy. Given the significant variation of tumor antigen expression among patients, the investigators aim to examine GD2, PSMA and CD276 expression in each patient's tumor sections by IHC staining, and combine two or three highly-expressed targets for the 4SCAR-T therapy. This individualized and multi-antigen-targeted approach is a new strategy to overcome the limited clinical outcome in the 4SCAR-T therapy against NB.

The purpose of this clinical study is to assess the feasibility, safety and efficacy of the combinational GD2, PSMA and CD276 4SCAR-T cell therapy against NB. Another goal of the study is to learn more about the function of the multi-4SCAR-T cells and their persistency in the patients.",,,NA,SINGLE_GROUP,,NONE,,,TREATMENT,,100,ESTIMATED,,,"PHASE1, PHASE2",INTERVENTIONAL,,,"Inclusion Criteria:

Gocatamig is a new type of immunotherapy that uses a person's immune system to find and destroy cancer cells. Ifinatamab deruxtecan (also known as I-DXd) is a drug which binds to a specific target on cancer cells and delivers treatment to destroy those cells. Durvalumab is a different type of immunotherapy that also destroys cancer cells. Researchers want to know if giving gocatamig, I-DXd, and gocatamig with I-DXd or durvalumab can treat SCLC that did not respond or stopped responding to a prior treatment.

The goals of this study are to learn:

* If gocatamig alone, I-DXd alone, and gocatamig with I-DXd or durvalumab are safe and well tolerated
* If people who receive gocatamig alone, I-DXd alone, and gocatamig with I-DXd or durvalumab have their SCLC get smaller or go away","This study will consist of two parts. Part 1 will assess the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of gocatamig and I-DXd at doses determined in study MK-6070-001 (NCT: NCT04471727).

ES-SCLC is a type of lung cancer that has spread throughout the lung, to the other lung, or to other parts of the body.

A standard (usual) treatment for ES-SCLC uses both chemotherapy and immunotherapy.

* Chemotherapy is a treatment that works to destroy cancer cells or stop them from growing.
* Immunotherapy is a treatment that helps the immune system fight cancer.

Gocatamig and I-DXd (short for ifinatamab deruxtecan) are study medicines. Researchers want to know if giving gocatamig and I-DXd together can treat ES-SCLC. Researchers will also look at giving the study medicines with standard treatment. Gocatamig is a T-cell engager therapy. I-DXd is an antibody drug conjugate.

* T-cell engager therapy is a certain type of immunotherapy that uses T-cells to find and destroy cancer cells.
* A T-cell is a type of white blood cell, which are cells that help the body fight infection.
* An antibody drug conjugate (ADC) is a treatment that attaches to a protein on cancer cells and delivers treatment to destroy those cells.

The goals of this study are to learn:

* About the safety of combining gocatamig and I-DXd and if people tolerate them together
* If people who receive gocatamig and I-DXd have ES-SCLC respond, which means the cancer gets smaller or goes away","In Part A, participants will be allocated to Arm 1 or Arm 2 per investigator's discretion.

Gocatamig is a new type of immunotherapy that uses a person's immune system to find and destroy cancer cells. Ifinatamab deruxtecan (also known as I-DXd) is a drug which binds to a specific target on cancer cells and delivers treatment to destroy those cells. Durvalumab is a different type of immunotherapy that also destroys cancer cells. Researchers want to know if giving gocatamig, I-DXd, and gocatamig with I-DXd or durvalumab can treat SCLC that did not respond or stopped responding to a prior treatment.

The goals of this study are to learn:

* If gocatamig alone, I-DXd alone, and gocatamig with I-DXd or durvalumab are safe and well tolerated
* If people who receive gocatamig alone, I-DXd alone, and gocatamig with I-DXd or durvalumab have their SCLC get smaller or go away","This study will consist of two parts. Part 1 will assess the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of gocatamig and I-DXd at doses determined in study MK-6070-001 (NCT: NCT04471727).

After the last dose, there will be a safety follow-up period lasting for 1 year and then a long-term follow-up up to 15 years.","This is a Phase II trial to evaluate the safety, tolerability, efficacy, and PK/ pharmacodynamic profiles of MT027 injected via ICV in participants with recurrent or progressive IDH-wildtype glioblastoma (WHO 2021 CNS Grade 4), who have previously received standard of care (SOC) therapy.

The study will begin with a safety run-in of 3 to 6 participants to evaluate the safety and tolerability of MT027 at a dose of 3×10\^7 cells. Once the DLT assessment is complete, an additional 34 participants will be enrolled, bringing the total to 40, to evaluate the treatment's efficacy. Each participant will undergo screening, treatment, safety follow-up, and long-term follow-up periods. Any participant who has discontinued from study treatment other than disease progression will also continue to have tumor assessments until disease progression, initiation of subsequent anticancer therapies, withdrawal from the study, or death, whichever comes first. Upon completion of the safety follow-up, all patients, except those who died, withdrew consent, or were lost to follow-up, will enter to the long-term follow-up. It is regarded as the end of the study when the last participant has completed the 1-year long-term follow-up, or all participants have progressed, died, or lost to follow-up, whichever comes first. MT027 will be given via ICV injection on Day 1 \& Day 15 of the first 28-day cycle, and the DLT observation period will be 28 days following the first dose of the first cycle (only for safety run-in group). After the DLT observation period, if the participant does not experience any unacceptable toxicities and disease progress, additional treatment may be continued bi-weekly in a 28-day cycle (Days 1 \& Day 15 of the 28-day cycle) until intolerable toxicity, disease progression, withdrawal from the study, or death, whichever comes first. When confirming disease progression, the study treatment may still be continued if there's a potential for benefit, based on PI's discretion and the participant's willingness, particularly when there are no better treatment options available. Investigational product (IP) may be temporarily interrupted to allow safety management and will resume the study treatment dose after participant's adverse events are recovered to the Grade 1 level or baseline, per PI's discretion.

tumors.

The main objectives of this study are :

* To Determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and recommended dose for expansion (RDE) of TJ101
* to show preliminary antitumor activity in patients with advanced solid tumors

Participants will:

* Receive intravenous (IV) infusions of TJ101 at escalating dose levels (during dose escalation) or at the selected expansion dose.
* Undergo regular tumor imaging to assess response.
* Provide blood samples for pharmacokinetics (PK) and biomarker analysis.
* Be monitored for side effects and overall tolerability.

This study is being conducted in adult patients with advanced or metastatic solid tumors who have exhausted standard treatment options","This is a first-in-human, Phase I, open-label, multicenter study designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK), immunogenicity, and preliminary efficacy of TJ101, a bispecific antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) targeting EGFR and B7-H3, in patients with advanced or metastatic solid tumors.

Study Objectives Phase Ia (Dose Escalation)

* Primary: Assess safety/tolerability; determine dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs), maximum tolerated dose (MTD), and recommended dose(s) for expansion (RDEs).
* Secondary: Characterize PK profile, assess preliminary anti-tumor activity, and evaluate immunogenicity.

Phase Ib (Dose Expansion)

* Primary: Further assess safety and preliminary anti-tumor activity of TJ101 at the selected RDEs.
* Secondary: Further characterize PK profile and immunogenicity.

Study Design

* Part 1: Dose Escalation (Phase Ia)
* Up to 72 patients with advanced/metastatic solid tumors.
* Six planned dose cohorts: IV every 3 weeks (Q3W).
* Accelerated titration for first cohort; 3+3 design for subsequent cohorts.
* Backfill cohorts (6-12 patients each) may be added at promising dose levels to refine safety, PK, and efficacy data.
* DLT evaluation window: 21 days after first infusion (Cycle 1).
* Safety Monitoring Committee (SMC) reviews all data to guide escalation, backfill, and RDE selection.

Part 2: Dose Expansion (Phase Ib)

* 40-180 patients, across tumor-specific cohorts
* Patients randomized to 2-3 RDEs of TJ101.
* 20-30 subjects per tumor type/dose level.
* Expansion will refine safety/PK and assess anti-tumor activity in biomarker-selected subgroups.
* Dosing: IV infusion on Day 1 of each 21-day cycle; continued until progression, unacceptable toxicity, withdrawal, or investigator decision.

Study Procedures \& Monitoring

* Screening: within 28 days prior to first dose.
* Safety Monitoring: continuous AE collection, labs, vitals, ECOG, ECGs, ophthalmologic exams, skin checks.
* Efficacy Assessments: imaging at baseline, then every 6 weeks (first 24 weeks), every 9 weeks thereafter, and every 12 weeks from year 2 until progression or new therapy.
* PK/Immunogenicity Sampling: intensive during Cycles 1 and 3; serial sampling in later cycles.
* Follow-up:

  * 30-day safety follow-up after last dose.
  * Survival follow-up every 3 months until death or study termination.

tumors.

The main objectives of this study are :

* To Determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and recommended dose for expansion (RDE) of TJ101
* to show preliminary antitumor activity in patients with advanced solid tumors

Participants will:

* Receive intravenous (IV) infusions of TJ101 at escalating dose levels (during dose escalation) or at the selected expansion dose.
* Undergo regular tumor imaging to assess response.
* Provide blood samples for pharmacokinetics (PK) and biomarker analysis.
* Be monitored for side effects and overall tolerability.

This study is being conducted in adult patients with advanced or metastatic solid tumors who have exhausted standard treatment options","This is a first-in-human, Phase I, open-label, multicenter study designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK), immunogenicity, and preliminary efficacy of TJ101, a bispecific antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) targeting EGFR and B7-H3, in patients with advanced or metastatic solid tumors.

Study Objectives Phase Ia (Dose Escalation)

* Primary: Assess safety/tolerability; determine dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs), maximum tolerated dose (MTD), and recommended dose(s) for expansion (RDEs).
* Secondary: Characterize PK profile, assess preliminary anti-tumor activity, and evaluate immunogenicity.

Phase Ib (Dose Expansion)

* Primary: Further assess safety and preliminary anti-tumor activity of TJ101 at the selected RDEs.
* Secondary: Further characterize PK profile and immunogenicity.

Study Design

* Part 1: Dose Escalation (Phase Ia)
* Up to 72 patients with advanced/metastatic solid tumors.
* Six planned dose cohorts: IV every 3 weeks (Q3W).
* Accelerated titration for first cohort; 3+3 design for subsequent cohorts.
* Backfill cohorts (6-12 patients each) may be added at promising dose levels to refine safety, PK, and efficacy data.
* DLT evaluation window: 21 days after first infusion (Cycle 1).
* Safety Monitoring Committee (SMC) reviews all data to guide escalation, backfill, and RDE selection.

Part 2: Dose Expansion (Phase Ib)

* 40-180 patients, across tumor-specific cohorts
* Patients randomized to 2-3 RDEs of TJ101.
* 20-30 subjects per tumor type/dose level.
* Expansion will refine safety/PK and assess anti-tumor activity in biomarker-selected subgroups.
* Dosing: IV infusion on Day 1 of each 21-day cycle; continued until progression, unacceptable toxicity, withdrawal, or investigator decision.

Study Procedures \& Monitoring

* Screening: within 28 days prior to first dose.
* Safety Monitoring: continuous AE collection, labs, vitals, ECOG, ECGs, ophthalmologic exams, skin checks.
* Efficacy Assessments: imaging at baseline, then every 6 weeks (first 24 weeks), every 9 weeks thereafter, and every 12 weeks from year 2 until progression or new therapy.
* PK/Immunogenicity Sampling: intensive during Cycles 1 and 3; serial sampling in later cycles.
* Follow-up:

  * 30-day safety follow-up after last dose.
  * Survival follow-up every 3 months until death or study termination.

Enrollment \& Duration

* Estimated enrollment: up to 252 patients.
* Study duration: \~ 2-3 years.",,,NA,SINGLE_GROUP,,NONE,,,TREATMENT,,200,ESTIMATED,,,PHASE1,INTERVENTIONAL,,,"Inclusion Criteria:

gynecologic cancers. As this is an early 1st in human study and the 1st intraperitoneal infusion of FT516, the safety of FT516 is confirmed prior to adding enoblituzumab as an intravenous infusion approximately 1 week prior to the 1st dose of FT516 and every 3 weeks beginning on Day 22 (1 week after the last dose of FT516). Each dose of FT516 is followed directly by an IP infusion of interleukin-2 (IL-2) to facilitate natural killer (NK) cell survival. A short course of outpatient lymphodepletion chemotherapy is given prior to the 1st dose of FT516.","FT516 is an off the shelf product comprised of allogeneic natural killer (NK) cells, expressing high-affinity non-cleavable CD16 (FT516). Enoblituzumab is an Fc-optimized monoclonal antibody that targets B7-H3 which is highly expressed on ovarian cancer. Based on data showing that within the ovarian cancer tumor microenvironment surface expression of CD16a on NK cells is diminished, the researchers hypothesize that the FT516 cellular product containing a non-cleavable CD16 will bypass the low CD16 expression issue and maximize NK cell cytotoxicity. Enoblituzumab is an Fc optimized humanized IgG1 monoclonal antibody that binds to B7-H3 (CD276). B7-H3 is an inhibitory immune checkpoint molecule that is widely expressed by a number of different tumor types and may play a key role in regulating the immune response. It is therefore hypothesized that the combination of FT516 with enoblituzumab will maximize NK cell cytotoxicity in patients with ovarian cancer.",,,NON_RANDOMIZED,SEQUENTIAL,"This study is conducted in two consecutive stages with 5 cohorts.

It is a next-generation, ready-to-use CAR-T product that can be used immediately and promptly for patients to solve the problem of unmet medical needs for a large number of patients who have a demand for CAR-T therapy but cannot receive it due to the common reasons of long production cycle, insufficient production capacity, and incompatibility of patients' T cells with the production conditions. In addition, the expected medical cost of allogeneic CAR-T cells is significantly lower, which can greatly alleviate the economic burden on patients.

MT027 is prepared by expressing a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) targeting B7H3 on gene-edited T cells through gene modification technology. MT027 products targeting the B7H3 target developed by Moxing Biotech avoid the potential graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) and host anti-graft reaction (HvGR) caused by the interaction between exogenous T cells and the patient's immune system, and have shown good safety and efficacy in recurrent high-grade glioma in the initial phase.","This study adopted a single-arm, open-label, single-center clinical trial design. The study population consisted of patients with high-grade glioma, aged 18 - 70 years old, whose B7H3 antigen expression was positive and had been confirmed by histology or cytology, and who had recurrence or progression after standard treatment. Subjects received local injection administration (intraventricular administration via an Ommaya reservoir or intrathecal administration into the lumbar cistern through lumbar puncture). For intrathecal injection via lumbar puncture, the dosage for each administration was divided into four dose levels: 1.0, 1.5, 2, 2.5 × 10⁷ cells per time, and the administration frequency was once every 4 weeks.

During the study period, adverse events were observed and recorded, with special attention paid to product-specific adverse reactions such as graft-versus-host disease (GvHD), cytokine release syndrome (CRS), and immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome (ICANS). Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and blood samples were collected to analyze PK and PD indicators such as CAR copy numbers and cytokines in the samples. Efficacy evaluations were conducted once per cycle, and efficacy indicators such as overall survival (OS), 12-month overall survival rate (12m-OS), objective response rate (ORR), and disease control rate (DCR) were calculated.",,,NA,SINGLE_GROUP,,NONE,,,TREATMENT,,12,ESTIMATED,,,PHASE1,INTERVENTIONAL,,,"Inclusion Criteria:

Approximately 10-20% of pediatric patients with pre B-ALL will relapse (1) and relapsed pre B-ALL is a leading cause of cancer death in children (2). Site of relapse and timing of first relapse from initial therapy are important factors that impact the survival rates after first relapse (3). The 5-year survival for pre B-ALL pediatric patients with early relapse is 25-50% (2). Pediatric patients who experience a late relapse have excellent survival rates with chemotherapy alone, however if they have MRD positivity after reinduction, this drops their survival rates down to 50-60% (4). The FDA approval of CD19-directed CAR-T cell therapy has increased treatment options for patients with refractory disease or those in second relapse. However, many patients, including those in first relapse do not fit the current criteria to receive this treatment. As well, regardless of the number of prior relapses, some patients in second relapse cannot tolerate the extended delay and ongoing therapy that is necessary for the commercial manufacturing of these cells at the commercial level.

This phase I/II trial will investigate a new CD19-directed CAR-T therapy manufactured locally with the goal of expediting the infusion to patients who were previously excluded, such as pediatric patients with relapsed B-cell NHL and patients in their initial (or greater) leukemic relapse. We hypothesize that CD19-directed CAR-T cells manufactured using the Miltenyi CliniMACs Prodigy System (UCD19 CAR-T) will be safe, well-tolerated, and show preliminary efficacy in pediatric patients with relapsed and/or refractory B-ALL or B-NHL.

gynecologic cancers. As this is an early 1st in human study and the 1st intraperitoneal infusion of FT516, the safety of FT516 is confirmed prior to adding enoblituzumab as an intravenous infusion approximately 1 week prior to the 1st dose of FT516 and every 3 weeks beginning on Day 22 (1 week after the last dose of FT516). Each dose of FT516 is followed directly by an IP infusion of interleukin-2 (IL-2) to facilitate natural killer (NK) cell survival. A short course of outpatient lymphodepletion chemotherapy is given prior to the 1st dose of FT516.","FT516 is an off the shelf product comprised of allogeneic natural killer (NK) cells, expressing high-affinity non-cleavable CD16 (FT516). Enoblituzumab is an Fc-optimized monoclonal antibody that targets B7-H3 which is highly expressed on ovarian cancer. Based on data showing that within the ovarian cancer tumor microenvironment surface expression of CD16a on NK cells is diminished, the researchers hypothesize that the FT516 cellular product containing a non-cleavable CD16 will bypass the low CD16 expression issue and maximize NK cell cytotoxicity. Enoblituzumab is an Fc optimized humanized IgG1 monoclonal antibody that binds to B7-H3 (CD276). B7-H3 is an inhibitory immune checkpoint molecule that is widely expressed by a number of different tumor types and may play a key role in regulating the immune response. It is therefore hypothesized that the combination of FT516 with enoblituzumab will maximize NK cell cytotoxicity in patients with ovarian cancer.",,,NON_RANDOMIZED,SEQUENTIAL,"This study is conducted in two consecutive stages with 5 cohorts. A minimum of 28 days must separate each cohort. Within a 3 patient cohort, a minimum of 14 days must separate the first and second patient. Stage 1 Step 1 uses a fast-track design (1 patient per cohort) with a minimum of 28 days between each patient until one of the following: a) 1st occurrence of a pre-defined adverse event at which point the study moves to Step 2. The cohort size increases from 1 to 3 patients with 2 additional patients added. Escalation in Step 2 continues until the 1st DLT at which point Stage 2 continual reassessment method (CRM) is activated.

Primary

* To determine, in a prospective fashion, if the response rate to high-dose IL-2 for patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma and ""good"" pathologic predictive features is significantly higher than a historical, unselected patient population.

Secondary

* To determine, in a prospective fashion, the response rate to high-dose IL-2 for patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma and ""poor"" pathologic predictive features and to compare this response rate to the response rate of patients with ""good"" pathologic predictive features.
* To determine if components of other predictive and prognostic models (e.g MSKCI or UCLA criteria) can help to further define the optimal population to receive high-dose IL2 for metastatic renal cell carcinoma.
* To identify features of the baseline immune function (arginine, arginase, T cell zeta chain) of patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma that are associated with response to high-dose IL-2.
* To identify new proteins or patterns of gene expression that might be associated with high-dose IL-2 responsiveness in order to further narrow the application of IL-2 therapy to those who will benefit the most.",,,NA,SINGLE_GROUP,,NONE,,,TREATMENT,,123,ACTUAL,,,PHASE2,INTERVENTIONAL,,,"Inclusion Criteria:

* If patients have measurable disease restricted to a solitary lesion, its neoplastic nature should be confirmed by cytology/histology.
* Patients must provide access to tissue blocks containing adequate tumor for interpretation and analysis.
* Patients must have measurable disease.
* Patients must have good performance status (ECOG 0 or 1; Karnofsky PS 100-80%).

* Patients with organ allografts.
* Patients who require or are likely to require systemic corticosteroid therapy for intercurrent illness.
* Patients with any significant medical disease other than the malignancy (e.g. COPD, patients with ascites or pleural effusions), which in the opinion of the investigator would significantly increase the risk of immunotherapy.

We constructed a chimeric switch receptor (CSR) containing the extracellular domain of PD1 fused to the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domain of the costimulatory molecule CD28. CSR modified T cells are able to recognize PD-L1-expressing tumor cells and transduce signals to activate T cells, which results in tumor killing. A truncated EGFR (tEGFR) which lacks of the ligand binding domain and cytoplasmic kinase domain of wildtype EGFR is incorporated into the CSR vector and is used for in vivo tracking and ablation of CSR T cells when necessary.

Signaling pathway of programmed death 1 (PD-1) and its ligand PD-L1 plays an important role in suppressing immune response against tumors. PD-L1 is over-expressed in 88% of glioblastoma.

We constructed a chimeric switch receptor (CSR) containing the extracellular domain of PD1 fused to the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domain of the costimulatory molecule CD28. CSR modified T cells are able to recognize PD-L1-expressing tumor cells and transduce signals to activate T cells, which results in tumor killing. A truncated EGFR (tEGFR) which lacks of the ligand binding domain and cytoplasmic kinase domain of wildtype EGFR is incorporated into the CSR vector and is used for in vivo tracking and ablation of CSR T cells when necessary.

Recent research has suggested that certain patients may respond better to IL-2 than others. The Cytokine Working Group is currently conducting a clinical trial that aims to identify and confirm this research and narrow the application of IL-2 to those patients most likely to benefit.","OBJECTIVES:

Primary

* To determine, in a prospective fashion, if the response rate to high-dose IL-2 for patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma and ""good"" pathologic predictive features is significantly higher than a historical, unselected patient population.

Secondary

* To determine, in a prospective fashion, the response rate to high-dose IL-2 for patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma and ""poor"" pathologic predictive features and to compare this response rate to the response rate of patients with ""good"" pathologic predictive features.
* To determine if components of other predictive and prognostic models (e.g MSKCI or UCLA criteria) can help to further define the optimal population to receive high-dose IL2 for metastatic renal cell carcinoma.
* To identify features of the baseline immune function (arginine, arginase, T cell zeta chain) of patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma that are associated with response to high-dose IL-2.
* To identify new proteins or patterns of gene expression that might be associated with high-dose IL-2 responsiveness in order to further narrow the application of IL-2 therapy to those who will benefit the most.",,,NA,SINGLE_GROUP,,NONE,,,TREATMENT,,123,ACTUAL,,,PHASE2,INTERVENTIONAL,,,"Inclusion Criteria:

* Patients must have histologically confirmed renal cell carcinoma that is metastatic or unresectable.
* If patients have measurable disease restricted to a solitary lesion, its neoplastic nature should be confirmed by cytology/histology.
* Patients must provide access to tissue blocks containing adequate tumor for interpretation and analysis.
* Patients must have measurable disease.
* Patients must have good performance status (ECOG 0 or 1; Karnofsky PS 100-80%).
* Patients must have adequate organ function.
* Patients must have no contraindication of vasopressor agents.
* Patients must be ≥ 18 years of age.

Exclusion Criteria:

* Patients who have received systemic therapy for metastatic disease.
* Patients with organ allografts.
* Patients who require or are likely to require systemic corticosteroid therapy for intercurrent illness.
* Patients with any significant medical disease other than the malignancy (e.g. COPD, patients with ascites or pleural effusions), which in the opinion of the investigator would significantly increase the risk of immunotherapy.
* Patients with a history of another malignancy within the past 5 years other than surgically cured non-melanoma skin cancer, carcinoma-in-situ or Stage I carcinoma of the cervix.",,False,80 Years,18 Years,,ALL,"ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",,True,SELECT,"The High-Dose Aldesleukin (IL-2) ""Select"" Trial for Patients With Metastatic Renal Cell Carcinoma",NCT00554515,NCT00536757,"The High-Dose Aldesleukin (IL-2) ""Select"" Trial: A Trial Designed to Prospectively Validate Predictive Models of Response to High Dose IL-2 Treatment in Patients With Metastatic Renal Cell Carcinoma",DFHCC 06-149,OTHER,Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center,,,"[{""id"": ""C082598"", ""term"": ""aldesleukin""}]",,,,NO,,,,,,2026-02-11,False,,False,,dmcdermo@bidmc.harvard.edu,Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center,,"David F.

Currently the main limitation of kidney transplantation is the occurrence of chronic graft dysfunction due to the CNI nephrotoxicity. Thus, strategies to minimize or stop CNI have been developed as belatacept, a fusion protein (CTLA4-Ig) blocking the ligand of the main CD28 costimulatory molecule. In the original phase III trial, used de novo in combination with MMF (without CNI) belatacept allowed to obtain a better renal function as soon as 1 year and a better graft and patient survival after 7 years. Despite these excellent results, belatacept has not become the gold standard due to a higher incidence of early rejection. In addition, belatacept is not covered by the french social security policy, because benefits are considered insufficient with respect to the cost. Patients with poor early graft function are a preferred indication of belatacept. It is then used instead of CNI at 3 months post-transplant allowing to improve kidney function without over-risk of rejection. Currently after conversion, belatacept is maintained indefinitely due to the supposed CNI chronic nephrotoxicity. However this one is more and more questionable. Thus, the investigators assume that in patients with poor function at 3 months posttransplantation the belatacept's benefit could be obtained by a transient replacement of CNI by belatacept from 3 to 12 months post-transplantation. It is the feasibility of this strategy and its medico-economic impact that the investigators wish to study.","The standard maintenance regimen in renal transplantation combines calcineurin inhibitor (CNI: ciclosporin or tacrolimus) and anti-metabolite drugs (mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) or mycophenolic acid (MPA)). CNI in the 1980s made kidney transplantation possible by drastically reducing acute rejection rates in the first year. Currently the main limitation of kidney transplantation is the occurrence of chronic graft dysfunction. While half of patients die with a functional graft, the other half return to dialysis and require retransplantation. Paradoxically, CNI has been identified as a leading cause of chronic graft dysfunction. Indeed, these molecules are nephrotoxic both : acutely and transitory due to a vasoconstrictor effect that modulates intra-renal hemodynamic and chronically due to extensive fibrosis. In the late 1990s, with the development of a new class of immunosuppressants, mammilian target of rapamycin (mTor) inhibitors (sirolimus and everolimus), CNI-free protocols were developed. The results were disappointing due in part to the undesirable effects of these treatments and secondly to the occurence of chronic rejections related to the appearance of Donor Specific Antibody (DSA) antibodies.

Finally in the mid-2000s belatacept is a fusion protein (CTLA4-Ig) blocking the ligands of the main costimulatory molecule (CD28) emerged. In the Phase III princeps assay (BENEFIT), this molecule was used as a maintenance treatment following transplantation (de novo) in combination with MMF (without CNI). Compared to the control group with CNI, patients receiving belatacept had better renal function from 1 year and after 7 years survival (graft and patient) were better. These benefits were attributed, on the one hand, to the absence of CNI and, on the other hand, to a very good control of the alloimmune response demonstrated by a lower incidence of DSA in the belatacept group.

Despite these excellent results, belatacept has not become the gold standard in renal transplantation for two main reasons. First, when it is used de novo (as in BENEFIT), there is a significant incidence of early rejection, known as ""costimulation blockade resistant"". The second issue is medico-economic. Indeed, to date and despite the accumulation of favorable data, in France and in most countries, belatacept has marketing authorization but is not supported by social security policy due to benefits regarded as insufficient with respect to the cost (related to the IV administration requiring hospital environment every month).

Consequently, it is important to precise which recipients may benefit more from this molecule. Patients, often elderly, with poor early function of the graft due to the poor quality of a marginal / ""extended criteria"" donor, are a good indication of belatacept not used de novo but after 3 months instead of CNI. This conversion most often allows to significantly improve the renal function of these patients to a much more acceptable level which remains stable beyond and without cost in terms of rejection (probably because of the time interval with the transplant). In this situation, several series reported success rates ranging from 80 to 100% with a rejection incidence between 0 and 20%. Failures are most often due to patients with non-primary graft function.

Currently after the conversion, belatacept is always maintained indefinitely most often in association with MMF. This usage generates significant costs and in fact, limits the access of belatacept for other patients. This practice is based on the dominant idea that chronic nephrotoxicity of CNI is the cause of chronic graft dysfunction.

However, while reversible acute toxicity, mediated by hemodynamic changes in intra-renal vascularization, is undeniable, the importance and even the reality of chronic, cumulative, irreversible CNI toxicity has been questioned during the last decade, while the importance of chronic anti-donor antibody (DSA) rejection to explain chronic graft dysfunction was demonstrated. The chronic toxicity of CNI is probable when high doses are necessary to prevent rejection during the first year but uncertain beyond.

Thus, the investigators assume that in patients with poor graft function at 3 months post-transplantation most of the benefit of belatacept could be obtained by a transient replacement of CNI from 3 to 12 months post-transplantation.

Indeed, in these often elderly patients, who have most often received an ""extended criteria"" graft (derived from a marginal donor), presenting chronic lesions, CNI-induced intra-renal vasoconstriction could more easily evolve to irreversible lesions in the context of ischemia-reperfusion inherent in the graft itself. At 1 year after transplantation the reintroduction of CNIs at minimized doses could only moderately alter the renal function allowing to maintain them at long term.

The purpose of this study is to demonstrate the feasibility of this transient treatment strategy (from 3 to 12 months post transplantation) in patients with poor function at 3 months.

From 3 months post-transplantation, patients will receive for 9 months (phase 1) a treatment with belatacept allowing to stop CNI. Then CNI will be reintroduced (phase 2) with a follow-up period of 6 months which will make it possible to judge the feasibility of this strategy.

Belatacept is the only biotherapy introduced successfully in transplantation. But this treatment, because of the limitations raised, has not yet found a definite place. Our project is to study a practical question: can the investigators stop belatacept after having introduced it early in the context of an early dysfunction while preserving the benefits. The decisive contribution of this study would be to prove the concept of a transient treatment by belatacept which has not been reported. The medico-economic consequences would be major, the cost of a long-term treatment by belatacept, especially because of its administration in hospital, being much higher than that of a conventional treatment.",,,NA,SINGLE_GROUP,,NONE,,,TREATMENT,,30,ESTIMATED,,,PHASE3,INTERVENTIONAL,,,"Inclusion Criteria:

Young female patients with SLE are more likely to develop myocardial infarction than matched healthy controls, and CVD is nowadays one of the most common causes of death (27%) in lupus patients. While traditional CV risk factors cannot explain such increased CV morbidity associated with SLE, common disease factors shared between SLE, atherosclerosis and treatment exposure may be of outmost importance in this process. Our group made 3 findings of particular interest that could link SLE pathogenesis and atherosclerosis-associated immune dysregulation: 1/ the investigators identified specific immunometabolites (circulating nucleotide-derived metabolites adenine and N4-acetylcytidine), which are increased in the circulation of SLE patients. These immunometabolites trigger a constitutive inflammasome activation resulting in aberrant IL1-β production. Given that IL1-β inhibition was reported to significantly reduce CV events without altering lipid levels, the investigators propose that these immunometabolites may represent novel candidate biomarkers of CV risk stratification in SLE. 2/ the investigators identified OX40L as an important costimulatory molecule implicated in follicular helper T cell (Tfh) activation in SLE. Interestingly, OX40L polymorphism has been associated to both SLE and atherosclerosis, and Tfh have been recently shown to accelerate atherosclerosis progression. 3/ Immune complexes-activated platelets sustain aberrant immune response in SLE and block immunosuppressive functions of regulatory T cells (Tregs) in a P-selectin/PSGL1 dependent manner. Selectins and Tregs cell dysfunction are well accepted players in atherosclerosis pathogenesis.

Thus there are multiple pathways that are shared between SLE and atherosclerosis and that may results in an increased risk of CV-associated morbidity in SLE patients. Exploring these interconnected pathways in SLE patients together with traditional and other well-established disease-related factors, might lead to a better stratification of CV risk in SLE.

The aim of this study is to investigate the accuracy, predictive value and utility of immunological disease-related biomarkers in stratifying CV risk in patients with SLE.",,,,NA,SINGLE_GROUP,,NONE,,,OTHER,,500,ESTIMATED,,,NA,INTERVENTIONAL,,,"Inclusion Criteria:

Participants must meet all of the following criteria to be eligible for randomization into the study:

1. Participants aged ≥18 years (follow local regulatory requirements if the legal age of consent for study participation is \>18 years old).
2. Has histologically or cytologically documented unresectable locally advanced or metastatic ESCC according to American Joint Committee on Cancer 8th edition staging system on ESCC.
3. Has disease progression post a platinum-based chemotherapy and an ICI treatment per global or local guidelines, with a maximum of 1 prior line of systemic therapy for unresectable advanced or metastatic ESCC.
4. The participant must provide adequate baseline tumor samples with sufficient quantity and quality of tumor tissue content as defined in the Laboratory Manual.
5. Has at least 1 measurable lesion on computed tomography (CT)/magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) according to RECIST v1.1 as assessed by the investigator. Measurable lesions should not be from a previously irradiated site. If the lesion at a previously irradiated site is the only selectable target lesion, a radiological assessment showing significant progression of the irradiated lesion should be provided by the investigator.
6. Has an ECOG PS of 0 or 1 within 7 days prior to Cycle 1 Day 1.

Exclusion Criteria:

Participants who meet any of the following criteria will be disqualified from entering the study:

1. Has received prior treatment with orlotamab, enoblituzumab, or other B7-H3 targeted agents, including I-DXd.
2. Has received any topoisomerase inhibitor.
3. Has histologically or cytologically confirmed adenosquamous carcinoma subtype.
4. Is ineligible to all the chemotherapies in the comparator arm due to prior progression or intolerance.
5. Has tumor invasion into organs located adjacent to the esophageal disease site (eg, aorta or respiratory tract) at an increased risk of bleeding or fistula as assessed by the investigator.
6. Clinically active brain metastases, spinal cord compression, or leptomeningeal carcinomatosis, defined as untreated or symptomatic, or requiring therapy with steroids or anticonvulsants to control associated symptoms. Subjects with clinically inactive or treated brain metastases who are asymptomatic (ie, without neurologic signs or symptoms and not requiring treatment with corticosteroids or anticonvulsants) may be included in the study. Subjects must have a stable neurologic status and discontinue corticosteroid usage for at least 2 weeks prior to Screening.
7. Has any of the following within the past 6 months: cerebrovascular accident, transient ischemic attack, other arterial thromboembolic event, or pulmonary embolism.
8. Has a clinically significant corneal disease.
9. Has a history of (non-infectious) interstitial lung disease (ILD)/pneumonitis that required corticosteroids, current ILD/pneumonitis, or suspected ILD/pneumonitis that cannot be ruled out by imaging at Screening.
10. Has clinically severe pulmonary compromise resulting from intercurrent pulmonary illnesses, including, but not limited to, any underlying pulmonary disorder (ie, pulmonary emboli within 3 months of the study randomization, severe asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease \[COPD\], restrictive lung disease, pleural effusion, etc), and potential pulmonary involvement caused by any autoimmune, connective tissue, or inflammatory disorders (eg, rheumatoid arthritis, Sjögren's syndrome, sarcoidosis, etc), prior pneumonectomy, or requirement for supplemental oxygen.

Currently the main limitation of kidney transplantation is the occurrence of chronic graft dysfunction due to the CNI nephrotoxicity. Thus, strategies to minimize or stop CNI have been developed as belatacept, a fusion protein (CTLA4-Ig) blocking the ligand of the main CD28 costimulatory molecule. In the original phase III trial, used de novo in combination with MMF (without CNI) belatacept allowed to obtain a better renal function as soon as 1 year and a better graft and patient survival after 7 years. Despite these excellent results, belatacept has not become the gold standard due to a higher incidence of early rejection. In addition, belatacept is not covered by the french social security policy, because benefits are considered insufficient with respect to the cost. Patients with poor early graft function are a preferred indication of belatacept. It is then used instead of CNI at 3 months post-transplant allowing to improve kidney function without over-risk of rejection. Currently after conversion, belatacept is maintained indefinitely due to the supposed CNI chronic nephrotoxicity. However this one is more and more questionable. Thus, the investigators assume that in patients with poor function at 3 months posttransplantation the belatacept's benefit could be obtained by a transient replacement of CNI by belatacept from 3 to 12 months post-transplantation. It is the feasibility of this strategy and its medico-economic impact that the investigators wish to study.","The standard maintenance regimen in renal transplantation combines calcineurin inhibitor (CNI: ciclosporin or tacrolimus) and anti-metabolite drugs (mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) or mycophenolic acid (MPA)). CNI in the 1980s made kidney transplantation possible by drastically reducing acute rejection rates in the first year. Currently the main limitation of kidney transplantation is the occurrence of chronic graft dysfunction. While half of patients die with a functional graft, the other half return to dialysis and require retransplantation. Paradoxically, CNI has been identified as a leading cause of chronic graft dysfunction. Indeed, these molecules are nephrotoxic both : acutely and transitory due to a vasoconstrictor effect that modulates intra-renal hemodynamic and chronically due to extensive fibrosis. In the late 1990s, with the development of a new class of immunosuppressants, mammilian target of rapamycin (mTor) inhibitors (sirolimus and everolimus), CNI-free protocols were developed. The results were disappointing due in part to the undesirable effects of these treatments and secondly to the occurence of chronic rejections related to the appearance of Donor Specific Antibody (DSA) antibodies.

Finally in the mid-2000s belatacept is a fusion protein (CTLA4-Ig) blocking the ligands of the main costimulatory molecule (CD28) emerged. In the Phase III princeps assay (BENEFIT), this molecule was used as a maintenance treatment following transplantation (de novo) in combination with MMF (without CNI). Compared to the control group with CNI, patients receiving belatacept had better renal function from 1 year and after 7 years survival (graft and patient) were better. These benefits were attributed, on the one hand, to the absence of CNI and, on the other hand, to a very good control of the alloimmune response demonstrated by a lower incidence of DSA in the belatacept group.

Despite these excellent results, belatacept has not become the gold standard in renal transplantation for two main reasons. First, when it is used de novo (as in BENEFIT), there is a significant incidence of early rejection, known as ""costimulation blockade resistant"". The second issue is medico-economic. Indeed, to date and despite the accumulation of favorable data, in France and in most countries, belatacept has marketing authorization but is not supported by social security policy due to benefits regarded as insufficient with respect to the cost (related to the IV administration requiring hospital environment every month).

Consequently, it is important to precise which recipients may benefit more from this molecule. Patients, often elderly, with poor early function of the graft due to the poor quality of a marginal / ""extended criteria"" donor, are a good indication of belatacept not used de novo but after 3 months instead of CNI. This conversion most often allows to significantly improve the renal function of these patients to a much more acceptable level which remains stable beyond and without cost in terms of rejection (probably because of the time interval with the transplant). In this situation, several series reported success rates ranging from 80 to 100% with a rejection incidence between 0 and 20%. Failures are most often due to patients with non-primary graft function.

Currently after the conversion, belatacept is always maintained indefinitely most often in association with MMF. This usage generates significant costs and in fact, limits the access of belatacept for other patients. This practice is based on the dominant idea that chronic nephrotoxicity of CNI is the cause of chronic graft dysfunction.

However, while reversible acute toxicity, mediated by hemodynamic changes in intra-renal vascularization, is undeniable, the importance and even the reality of chronic, cumulative, irreversible CNI toxicity has been questioned during the last decade, while the importance of chronic anti-donor antibody (DSA) rejection to explain chronic graft dysfunction was demonstrated. The chronic toxicity of CNI is probable when high doses are necessary to prevent rejection during the first year but uncertain beyond.

Thus, the investigators assume that in patients with poor graft function at 3 months post-transplantation most of the benefit of belatacept could be obtained by a transient replacement of CNI from 3 to 12 months post-transplantation.

Indeed, in these often elderly patients, who have most often received an ""extended criteria"" graft (derived from a marginal donor), presenting chronic lesions, CNI-induced intra-renal vasoconstriction could more easily evolve to irreversible lesions in the context of ischemia-reperfusion inherent in the graft itself. At 1 year after transplantation the reintroduction of CNIs at minimized doses could only moderately alter the renal function allowing to maintain them at long term.

The purpose of this study is to demonstrate the feasibility of this transient treatment strategy (from 3 to 12 months post transplantation) in patients with poor function at 3 months.

From 3 months post-transplantation, patients will receive for 9 months (phase 1) a treatment with belatacept allowing to stop CNI. Then CNI will be reintroduced (phase 2) with a follow-up period of 6 months which will make it possible to judge the feasibility of this strategy.

Belatacept is the only biotherapy introduced successfully in transplantation. But this treatment, because of the limitations raised, has not yet found a definite place. Our project is to study a practical question: can the investigators stop belatacept after having introduced it early in the context of an early dysfunction while preserving the benefits. The decisive contribution of this study would be to prove the concept of a transient treatment by belatacept which has not been reported. The medico-economic consequences would be major, the cost of a long-term treatment by belatacept, especially because of its administration in hospital, being much higher than that of a conventional treatment.

A secondary objective is to measure by flow cytometry the evolution of the absolute and relative amount of regulatory T lymphocytes. Indeed, the negative effect of belatacept on this essential lymphocyte population remains very controversial.",,,NA,SINGLE_GROUP,,NONE,,,TREATMENT,,48,ESTIMATED,,,PHASE3,INTERVENTIONAL,,,"Inclusion Criteria:

Young female patients with SLE are more likely to develop myocardial infarction than matched healthy controls, and CVD is nowadays one of the most common causes of death (27%) in lupus patients. While traditional CV risk factors cannot explain such increased CV morbidity associated with SLE, common disease factors shared between SLE, atherosclerosis and treatment exposure may be of outmost importance in this process. Our group made 3 findings of particular interest that could link SLE pathogenesis and atherosclerosis-associated immune dysregulation: 1/ the investigators identified specific immunometabolites (circulating nucleotide-derived metabolites adenine and N4-acetylcytidine), which are increased in the circulation of SLE patients. These immunometabolites trigger a constitutive inflammasome activation resulting in aberrant IL1-β production. Given that IL1-β inhibition was reported to significantly reduce CV events without altering lipid levels, the investigators propose that these immunometabolites may represent novel candidate biomarkers of CV risk stratification in SLE. 2/ the investigators identified OX40L as an important costimulatory molecule implicated in follicular helper T cell (Tfh) activation in SLE. Interestingly, OX40L polymorphism has been associated to both SLE and atherosclerosis, and Tfh have been recently shown to accelerate atherosclerosis progression. 3/ Immune complexes-activated platelets sustain aberrant immune response in SLE and block immunosuppressive functions of regulatory T cells (Tregs) in a P-selectin/PSGL1 dependent manner. Selectins and Tregs cell dysfunction are well accepted players in atherosclerosis pathogenesis.

Thus there are multiple pathways that are shared between SLE and atherosclerosis and that may results in an increased risk of CV-associated morbidity in SLE patients. Exploring these interconnected pathways in SLE patients together with traditional and other well-established disease-related factors, might lead to a better stratification of CV risk in SLE.

The aim of this study is to investigate the accuracy, predictive value and utility of immunological disease-related biomarkers in stratifying CV risk in patients with SLE.",,,,NA,SINGLE_GROUP,,NONE,,,OTHER,,500,ESTIMATED,,,NA,INTERVENTIONAL,,,"Inclusion Criteria:

Study Purpose:

The purpose of the study is to investigate the underlying immunological processes in GCA and to study the pattern of expression of immune response over time to give us information about how best to monitor GCA.

End Point:

The end point will be the final visit of the final patient.

Milestones:

The project is in 3 phases. In phase 1 (0-2 years) patients will be recruited to fulfil the specified primary and secondary objectives. In phase 2 (0-4 years), these patients will be followed up for a total of 2 years each, or until they are discharged from clinic.

According to the SEER Cancer Statistics Review, the incidence was estimated to be at around 1·6 per 100000 people in 2014, with around 6000 new cases diagnosed in 2018. This disease is more frequent in children aged 1-4 years, then drops reaching the lowermost point between 25 years and 45 years. Generally, around 60% of ALL cases are diagnosed before the age of 20 years. Despite significant improvements in 5-year overall survival reaching around 90% in children, only 25% of patients older than 50 years old were alive 5 years after diagnosis1,2. These survival figures are much worse when dealing with relapsed disease. Cases of relapsed or refractory ALL are usually offered allogeneic stem cell transplantation that can establish meaningful disease control after achieving the best disease control depicted in lack of measurable residual disease3. However, the inability of performing allogeneic stem cell transplantation in some patients, especially elderly patients, represents unmet needs for advancing treatment for these challenging ALL cases.

Cellular immunotherapy with CD19-directed chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cells has demonstrated encouraging results for the treatment of B-cell ALL (B-ALL). Currently used CAR T-cells are genetically engineered autologous T cells that express the antigen-binding domain linked to a costimulatory molecule and an intracellular T-cell receptor signaling domain. CAR T-cells function in a major histocompatibility complex-independent manner. Because of its expression on nearly all B-ALL, CD19 became the most sensible target. This paved the way for using tisagenlecleucel and brexucabtagene autoleucel in patients with B-ALL with astonishing outcomes4-6. However, the dependence on expression of the antigen of target can be an ""Achilles' heel"" for CAR T-cells similar to monoclonal antibodies, and loss of this target is a major escape mechanism by which cancer cells can evade immunotherapy. Mechanisms of antigenic loss may include genetic modulations, epitope masking, or a cell lineage switch with secondary loss of the target epitope7.

Cell plasticity is the ability of cells to be reprogrammed and to alter their fate and identity, which can enable homeostasis and restoration following injury. Pathological plasticity allows cancer cells to acquire new phenotypic and/or functional features leading to disease progression and resistance to therapy8. One of the most studied and established phenotypic and functional plasticity is KMT2A-r ALL9. The seminal work of Dr. John Dick and his lab in establishing the concept of leukemia stem cell was instrumental to the field. Transplantation of human ALL into NOD/SCID mice generates a disease in these mice that is reminiscent of the human disease10. The attributes of self-renewal and clonogenic proliferation are considered ""functional"" markers for stemness of these leukemia initiating cells. Because some of these functional assays are laborious, multiple efforts have been exerted to uncover the most accurate markers to label these cells that cab reliably predict this unique cellular population. In addition to cell-intrinsic factors for plasticity that are mentioned above, cell-extrinsic or ""niche"" elements can fuel cellular plasticity when they occur. Despite these limitations, CD34+CD38- cell fraction is most likely to harbor the most primitive and quiescent cells that can fuel disease existence11.

This type of tumor is aggressive and infiltrates the structures of the brain stem. Treatment options are limited due to the location of the tumor, making it impossible to surgically remove the mass like other brain cancers. The standard treatment for this type of tumor is radiation therapy, as this type of cancer does not respond to chemotherapy or currently available targeted drugs. However, radiation therapy has been found to be ineffective and does not improve survival rates.

Currently, there is development in cancer treatment using immunotherapy, where the patient's immune cells are genetically modified to target the cancer, also known as CAR T cells, for the treatment of recurrent or refractory cancers in solid tumors and brain cancers. The research project aims to study the efficacy and safety of treating patients with pontine glioma using T cells that are antigen-specific and have signals from the interleukin-7 receptor alpha and are specific to the B7H3 antigen on the tumor surface. This research is the first of its kind in Thai patients.

According to the SEER Cancer Statistics Review, the incidence was estimated to be at around 1·6 per 100000 people in 2014, with around 6000 new cases diagnosed in 2018. This disease is more frequent in children aged 1-4 years, then drops reaching the lowermost point between 25 years and 45 years. Generally, around 60% of ALL cases are diagnosed before the age of 20 years. Despite significant improvements in 5-year overall survival reaching around 90% in children, only 25% of patients older than 50 years old were alive 5 years after diagnosis1,2. These survival figures are much worse when dealing with relapsed disease. Cases of relapsed or refractory ALL are usually offered allogeneic stem cell transplantation that can establish meaningful disease control after achieving the best disease control depicted in lack of measurable residual disease3. However, the inability of performing allogeneic stem cell transplantation in some patients, especially elderly patients, represents unmet needs for advancing treatment for these challenging ALL cases.

Cellular immunotherapy with CD19-directed chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cells has demonstrated encouraging results for the treatment of B-cell ALL (B-ALL). Currently used CAR T-cells are genetically engineered autologous T cells that express the antigen-binding domain linked to a costimulatory molecule and an intracellular T-cell receptor signaling domain. CAR T-cells function in a major histocompatibility complex-independent manner. Because of its expression on nearly all B-ALL, CD19 became the most sensible target. This paved the way for using tisagenlecleucel and brexucabtagene autoleucel in patients with B-ALL with astonishing outcomes4-6. However, the dependence on expression of the antigen of target can be an ""Achilles' heel"" for CAR T-cells similar to monoclonal antibodies, and loss of this target is a major escape mechanism by which cancer cells can evade immunotherapy. Mechanisms of antigenic loss may include genetic modulations, epitope masking, or a cell lineage switch with secondary loss of the target epitope7.

Cell plasticity is the ability of cells to be reprogrammed and to alter their fate and identity, which can enable homeostasis and restoration following injury. Pathological plasticity allows cancer cells to acquire new phenotypic and/or functional features leading to disease progression and resistance to therapy8. One of the most studied and established phenotypic and functional plasticity is KMT2A-r ALL9. The seminal work of Dr. John Dick and his lab in establishing the concept of leukemia stem cell was instrumental to the field. Transplantation of human ALL into NOD/SCID mice generates a disease in these mice that is reminiscent of the human disease10. The attributes of self-renewal and clonogenic proliferation are considered ""functional"" markers for stemness of these leukemia initiating cells. Because some of these functional assays are laborious, multiple efforts have been exerted to uncover the most accurate markers to label these cells that cab reliably predict this unique cellular population. In addition to cell-intrinsic factors for plasticity that are mentioned above, cell-extrinsic or ""niche"" elements can fuel cellular plasticity when they occur. Despite these limitations, CD34+CD38- cell fraction is most likely to harbor the most primitive and quiescent cells that can fuel disease existence11.

These cancers often do not respond to other chemotherapy drugs or targeted therapies available today. As a result, there is currently no effective treatment for pediatric solid tumors that have recurred or are unresponsive to standard treatments.

At present, immunotherapy for cancer treatment is being developed. This involves genetically modifying the patient\&#39;s immune cells to target specific cancer cells, known as CAR T cells. This approach is used to treat recurrent or unresponsive solid tumors and brain cancers that do not respond to standard treatments.

The research aims to study the efficacy and safety of treating pediatric patients with recurrent or unresponsive solid tumors using a type of immunotherapy called CAR T cells. These cells are engineered to express a chimeric antigen receptor that includes an interleukin-7 receptor alpha signaling domain and targets the B7-H3 antigen on tumor surfaces. This research is the first of its kind conducted on Thai patients. The research team expects this treatment to be highly safe and effective in controlling cancer.",,,NA,SINGLE_GROUP,3+3 dose escalation study,NONE,,,TREATMENT,,9,ESTIMATED,,,PHASE1,INTERVENTIONAL,,,"Inclusion Criteria:

3. Age 1 - 25 years
4. Sex: Male or female
5. Performance status: Lansky or Karnofsky score not less than 50
6. Life expectancy not less than 12 weeks
7. Normal organ function

   * AST (SGOT) below 5 times the upper limit of normal (ULN)
   * ALT (SGPT) below 5 times the upper limit of normal (ULN)
   * Total bilirubin below 3 times the upper limit of normal (ULN)
   * Creatinine below 5 times the upper limit of normal (ULN)
   * SpO2 room air not less than 90%
8. Prior therapy wash-out before planned leukapheresis

   * Not less than 7 days post last chemotherapy/biologic therapy administration
   * 3 half-lives or 30 days, whichever is shorter after the last dose of antitumor antibody therapy
   * At least 30 days from most recent cellular infusion
   * All systemically administered corticosteroid treatment therapy must be stable or decreasing within 1 week prior to enrollment with a maximum of 0.5 mg/kg/day dose of methylprednisolone. Corticosteroid physiologic replacement therapy is allowed
9. Participants and/or legal guardians must have the ability to understand and willingness to sign a written informed consent and/or assent document

Exclusion Criteria:

1. Presence of greater than or equal to grade 3 cardiac dysfunction or symptomatic arrythmia requiring intervention
2. Presence of primary immunodeficiency or bone marrow failure syndrome
3. Presence of uncontrolled intercurrent illness including but not limited to ongoing or active infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, pulmonary abnormalities, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements
4. Pregnant or breastfeeding women were excluded from this study because CAR-T cell therapy may be associated with the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Women of childbearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test. Because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with CAR-T cells, breastfeeding should be discontinued. These potential risks may also apply to other agents used in this study. Participants of childbearing or child-fathering potential must be willing to practice birth control from the time of enrollment in this study and for four months after receiving CAR-T-cell infusion.

spread from where it first started to nearby tissue, lymph nodes, or distant parts of the body (advanced) and who are undergoing treatment for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Cabozantinib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as nivolumab, may help the body's immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Giving cabozantinib and nivolumab may shrink or stabilize cancer in patients undergoing treatment for HIV.","PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

I. To determine the safety of combined nivolumab and cabozantinib s-malate (XL184 \[cabozantinib\]) in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) patients with advanced solid tumors.

II. To determine the feasibility to deliver the combined nivolumab and XL184 (cabozantinib) for a minimum of 4 cycles in at least 75% of the subjects in the expanded cohort with Kaposi sarcoma (KS) or to achieve a confirmed objective response.

SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

I. To observe and record anti-tumor activity in subjects with Kaposi sarcoma (KS).

II. To assess the effect of treatment on participants' immune status (CD4 and CD8 cell counts) and HIV viral loads.

III. To preliminarily evaluate the objective response rate (ORR) to the combination treatment in subjects with KS.

EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

I. To assess duration of response (DOR), progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS) in subjects with KS.

II. To assess the PD-L1 immunohistochemistry (IHC) status in tumors and tumor microenvironment and its association with clinical outcome.

III. To assess the expression characteristics and cellular distribution of immune checkpoints (PD-L1, B7x, HHLA2, B7H3), infiltrating immune cells (CD4 T cells, CD8 T cells, regulatory T-cells \[Treg\], myeloid-derived suppressor cell \[MDSC\]), and other tumor microenvironment biomarkers (VEGF, VEGFR, MET, and AXL) in the tissue by multiplex quantitative immunofluorescence (MQIF).

IV. To correlate markers of immune activation and expansion of immune cell subsets and cytokines with clinical outcomes.

V. To assess the treatment effects on latent HIV reservoir. VI. To investigate the dynamic changes of immune checkpoints, angiogenesis markers, and infiltrating immune cells among subjects with available pre- and post-treatment biopsy samples (including subjects with Kaposi sarcoma \[KS\]).

OUTLINE:

Patients receive cabozantinib s-malate orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-28 of each cycle and nivolumab intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on day 1 of each cycle. Cycles repeat every 28 days for up to 1 year or 1 year after a partial response is achieved, or 6 months after a complete response is achieved in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients also undergo a computed tomography (CT) scan and/or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) as well as blood sample collection throughout the trial.

This type of tumor is aggressive and infiltrates the structures of the brain stem. Treatment options are limited due to the location of the tumor, making it impossible to surgically remove the mass like other brain cancers. The standard treatment for this type of tumor is radiation therapy, as this type of cancer does not respond to chemotherapy or currently available targeted drugs. However, radiation therapy has been found to be ineffective and does not improve survival rates.

* Patients with histologically confirmed diagnosis of medulloblastoma that is recurrent, progressive, or refractory to standard therapy. All tumors must have histologic verification at either time of initial diagnosis or recurrence. Note: For this study, refractory disease is specifically defined as presence of persistent abnormality on conventional MRI that is further distinguished by histology (tissue sample) or advanced imaging, i.e., diffusion weighted sequences or MR spectroscopy.
* Patients must have disease, defined as tumor measurable in two perpendicular diameters on MRI, OR diffuse leptomeningeal disease, OR clear MRI evidence of disease that may not be measurable in two perpendicular diameters. Patients may have tumor cells in CSF with or without radiographic evidence of disease at time of enrollment.
* Patients must be \< 22 years of age at time of enrollment.
* Protocol treatment with radioimmunotherapy (131I-omburtamab) will require the presence of an appropriate intraventricular access device (e.g., programmable ventriculoperitoneal \[VP\] shunt or Ommaya reservoir). Patients are not required to have an existing programmable VP shunt or Ommaya at time of study enrollment but must be willing and able to undergo a surgical procedure to have one placed prior to Radioimmunotherapy. Note: Patients with an existing intraventricular VP shunt without a programmable component must be willing and able to undergo modification of the shunt before treatment with 131I-omburtamab.
* Patients must have recurrent, progressive, or refractory medulloblastoma after prior craniospinal irradiation (CSI) therapy with or without prior chemotherapy, unless CSI is contraindicated or determined to be not in the best interest of patient due to underlying medical conditions or declined by patient/family. Patients must have experienced no more than two recurrences of medulloblastoma or have refractory disease. Note: Patients with contraindications to radiation therapy are still eligible.
* Patients must have received their last dose of known myelosuppressive anticancer therapy at least 21 days prior to enrollment or at least 42 days if prior nitrosourea.
