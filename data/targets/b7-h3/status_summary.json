Besides, intraoperative frozen-section analysis of resection margins of OS is often restricted by the hard tissues around OS, which makes it impossible to know whether a negative margin is achieved. Herein, based on the high expression of B7-H3 in OS, a targeted probe B7H3-IRDye800CW is synthesized by conjugating anti-B7H3 antibody and IRDye800CW. This trial is aimed to investigate R0-resection rate and 2-y local recurrence rate after using this probe in Musculoskeletal tumor surgery for osteosarcoma as well as the safety parameters of this probe in human."

The experimental treatment in this study combines two different ways the body fights cancer, and they are antibodies and T cells. Antibodies are proteins that protect the body from foreign invaders like bacteria. Antibodies work by attaching to these bacteria or substances, which stops them from growing and causing bad effects. T cells are special infection-fighting blood cells that can kill viruses and other cells, including tumor cells. Antibodies and T cells have been used to treat patients with cancer. They both have shown promise, but neither alone has been able to cure most patients. The treatment that is being studied in this study is called autologous T lymphocyte chimeric antigen receptor cells targeted against the B7-H3 antigen and containing inducible caspase 9 safety switch (iC9). The short name for this treatment is iC9.CAR.B7-H3 T cells. For the rest of this consent, we will refer to the iC9.CAR.B7-H3 T cells as the modified CAR-T cells for ease of reading this consent."

    "details": "Background: Patients with refractory and/or recurrent solid tumors have poor prognosis despite complex multimodal therapy; therefore, novel curative approaches are needed. The investigators are attempting to use T cells obtained directly from the patient, which can be genetically modified to express a 4th generation CD276-specific chimeric antigen receptor (4SCAR-276). The CAR molecules enable the T cells to recognize and kill tumor cells through the recognition of the surface CD276, which is expressed at high levels on tumor cells including brain tumors, Ewing's sarcoma (PNET) and many other tumors but not at significant levels on normal tissues. This study will evaluate the side effects and the best dose of a novel 4th generation anti-CD276 CAR T cells to target refractory and/or recurrent solid tumors.\n\nDesign:\n\n1. Participants will be screened through physical exam and medical history. Blood and tumor tissue samples will be collected. Imaging studies will be performed.\n2. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) will be obtained by apheresis, and T cells will be activated and modified to express the 4SCAR-276 gene.\n3. On Day -5 to -7, PBMC will be activated and enriched for T cells, which will be followed by 4SCAR-276 lentiviral transduction. The total culture time is approximately 5-7 days.\n4. Participants will receive a preparative conditioning regimen comprising cyclophosphamide/fludarabine to prepare their immune system to accept the modified CAR T cells. The preparative regimen will be based on patient immune condition and consistent with standard chemotherapy conditioning regimen.\n5. The patients will receive \\~10\\^6 CART cells/kg body weight per infusion, and may receive additional booster CART infusions if positive outcome is recorded."

The safety of iC9-CAR.B7-H3 T cells administered intraperitoneally via a port/catheter will be investigated using a modified 3+3 design with a starting dose of 1 ×106. The data from the dose escalation will be used to determine a recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D), which will be decided on based on the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and additional factors such as the ability to manufacture sufficient cells for infusion. Additional subjects will be enrolled in an expansion cohort at the recommended phase 2 dose.\n\nSubjects will receive standard-of-care therapy e.g., chemotherapy or radiation therapy to stabilize their disease if the treating physician feels it is in the subject's best interests before the cell therapy.\n\nSubjects with ≥ grade 4 Cytokine Release Syndrome (CRS) or Immune Effector Cell-Associated Neurotoxicity Syndrome (ICANS) or grade 3 CRS or ICANS that do not improve to grade 0-1 within 72 hours will be given a 0.4mg/kg of rimiducid.

    "details": "Traditional treatments have limited efficacy in patients with pancreatic cancer, and molecular targeted therapy also has limited benefits. According to the results of the CONKO-005 clinical trial, compared with the single-agent Gemcitabine (Gemcitabine) treatment, the combined use of Erlotinib (Erolotinib) did not prolong the survival time of pancreatic cancer patients in postoperative adjuvant treatment. However, another phase III clinical result for patients with advanced pancreatic cancer found that compared with gemcitabine monotherapy, the survival of patients in the combined gemcitabine and erlotinib treatment group was significantly improved (6.24 months VS 5.91 months). The one-year survival rate has also improved (23% VS 17%). As a result, the FDA approved the \"gemcitabine + erlotinib\" combination regimen in 2005 for patients with locally advanced unresectable pancreatic cancer or distant metastases. However, this program only improves survival for about 10 days, making it difficult for the targeted drug erlotinib to achieve greater clinical benefit in the treatment of pancreatic cancer. In February 2019, the FDA approved olapa, an inhibitor that targets poly-ADP ribose polymerase, for the maintenance treatment of patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer who carry BRCA gene mutations, and then the population of patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer who carry BRCA gene mutations The limited quantity limits the scope of clinical application of olaparib. Therefore, it is necessary to explore new anti-pancreatic cancer therapeutic targets.\n\nCD276 (B7-H3) is a member of the B7 costimulatory molecule family. Its mRNA is widely expressed in tissues, but the protein expression is limited. It is expressed in resting fibroblasts, endothelial cells, osteoblasts, amniotic fluid stem cells and other non-immune cells, and The surface of induced antigen-presenting cells and NK cells. Many studies have revealed that B7-H3 is overexpressed in a variety of tumors, including melanoma, pancreatic cancer, breast cancer, prostate cancer, colorectal cancer and other tumors, and its expression level is closely related to the poor prognosis and clinical outcome of patients . Preclinical studies have confirmed that the expression of CD276 mRNA in pancreatic cancer tissues is significantly higher than that of normal adjacent groups."

CAR T cells are delivered via an indwelling catheter into the tumor resection cavity or ventricular system in children and young adults with diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (DIPG), diffuse midline glioma (DMG), and recurrent or refractory CNS tumors.\n\nA child or young adult meeting all eligibility criteria, including having a CNS catheter placed into the tumor resection cavity or into their ventricular system, and meeting none of the exclusion criteria, will have their T cells collected. The T cells will then be bioengineered into a second-generation CAR T cell that targets B7H3-expressing tumor cells. Patients will be assigned to one of 3 treatment arms based on location or type of their tumor. Patients with supratentorial tumors will be assigned to Arm A, and will receive their treatment into the tumor cavity. Patients with either infratentorial or metastatic/leptomeningeal tumors will be assigned to Arm B, and will have their treatment delivered into the ventricular system. The first 3 patients enrolled onto the study must be at least 15 years of age and assigned to Arm A or Arm B. Patients with DIPG will be assigned to Arm C and have their treatment delivered into the ventricular system. The patient's newly engineered T cells will be administered via the indwelling catheter for two courses. In the first course patients in Arms A and B will receive a weekly dose of CAR T cells for three weeks, followed by a week off, an examination period, and then another course of weekly doses for three weeks. Patients in Arm C will receive a dose of CAR T cells every other week for 3 weeks, followed by a week off, an examination period, and then dosing every other week for 3 weeks. Following the two courses, patients in all Arms will undergo a series of studies including MRI to evaluate the effect of the CAR T cells and may have the opportunity to continue receiving additional courses of CAR T cells if the patient has not had adverse effects and if more of their T cells are available.\n\nThe hypothesis is that an adequate amount of B7H3-specific CAR T cells can be manufactured to complete two courses of treatment with 3 or 2 doses given on a weekly schedule followed by one week off in each course. The other hypothesis is that B7H3-specific CAR T cells can safely be administered through an indwelling CNS catheter or delivered directly into the brain via indwelling catheter to allow the T cells to directly interact with the tumor cells for each patient enrolled on the study. Secondary aims of the study will include evaluating CAR T cell distribution with the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), the extent to which CAR T cells egress or traffic into the peripheral circulation or blood stream, and, if tissues samples from multiple timepoints are available, also evaluate disease response to B7-H3 CAR T cell locoregional therapy."

CAR T cells are delivered via an indwelling catheter into the ventricular system in children and young adults with diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (DIPG), diffuse midline glioma (DMG), and recurrent or refractory CNS tumors.\n\nA child or young adult meeting all eligibility criteria, including having a CNS catheter placed into their ventricular system, and meeting none of the exclusion criteria will have their T cells collected. The T cells will then be bioengineered into a second-generation CAR T cell that target B7H3, EGFR806, HER2, and IL13-zetakine on tumor cells.\n\nPatients will be assigned to 1 of 2 treatment Arms based on the type of their tumor:\n\n* Arm A is for patients with DIPG (meaning primary disease localized to the pons, metastatic disease is allowed) anytime after standard radiation OR after progression.\n* Arm B is for patients with non-pontine DMG (meaning DMG in other parts of the brain such as the thalamus or spine) anytime after standard radiation OR after progression. This Arm also includes other recurrent/refractory CNS tumors."

Post-initial dosing requires a 4-week observation period for dose-limiting toxicities (DLT) graded per NCI-CTCAE v5.0 criteria, followed by subsequent 14-day interval administrations. Following 6 completed treatment cycles (12 weeks), participants may either transition to surveillance follow-up or continue therapy per investigator-determined risk-benefit analysis.\n\nThe hybrid accelerated titration \"3+3\" design initiates with single-patient cohorts for preliminary dose evaluation, transitioning to conventional 3+3 methodology (minimum 3 patients/cohort) for subsequent dose levels. Protocol-defined dose escalation beyond predetermined thresholds requires documented consensus between investigators and sponsors, contingent upon comprehensive review of cumulative safety parameters (including DLT absence) and emerging efficacy indicators.\n\nThe trial progresses through sequential Phase IA (dose-finding) and Phase IB (dose-expansion) stages. Phase Ia cessation triggers include either confirmation of Recommended Phase II Dose (RP2D) or investigator-verified favorable therapeutic index at any dose level.\n\nAn interim analysis will be conducted upon Phase IA completion, followed by submission of an ethical amendment application prior to initiating Phase IB. Phase IB will be initiated with multi-cohort expansion (n=9-18 per cohort) across prespecified malignancies: colorectal adenocarcinoma (CRC), gastric carcinoma (GC), high-grade serous ovarian carcinoma (HGSOC), breast cancer (BC), non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), small cell lung cancer (SCLC), metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC), clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC), and cervical squamous cell carcinoma (CSCC), etc."

Subjects will be randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to 8.0 mg/kg and 12.0 mg/kg of HS-20093 in cohort 1 and will receive 12.0 mg/kg in cohort 2.\n\nPhase 2b: The study will be conducted in patients with advanced osteosarcoma upon disease progression after standard treatment. Subjects will receive HS-20093 at the recommended dose from Phase 2a.\n\nAll patients will be carefully followed for adverse events during the study treatment and for 90 days after the last dose of HS-20093. Subjects will be permitted to continue therapy with assessments for progression if the product is well tolerated and sustained clinical benefit exists."

    "details": "Neuroblastoma is one of the most aggressive childhood tumors arising from neural crest cells. Nearly 50% of patients with high risk disease have poor long-term survival even after multimodal treatments. Novel immunotherapy targeting tumor-specific antigens has been developed to meet the desperate need.\n\nDisialoganglioside (GD2) is a well-studied tumor associated antigen which is expressed uniformly in NB but restrictedly in normal tissue. Over the past few years, CAR-T therapy against GD2 in NB has achieved encouraging but modest outcomes. Only a fraction of patients achieved measurable responses. Like for many other solid tumors, CAR-T therapy for NB is not as effective as for hematologic malignancies.\n\nIn this study, the investigators use \"multiple targeting\" approach as the strategy to overcome the challenge in treating NB. Prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) is expressed in normal prostate but is upregulated in prostate tumor. However, PSMA expression is not restricted to prostate cancer. By immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining, the investigators confirmed that PSMA is expressed in a variety of solid tumors, including brain tumor, neuroblastoma and some lymphoma tumor tissues. Therefore, PSMA could potentially serve as a promising target for antigen-specific immunotherapy in patients with NB. In addition, CD276 (B7-H3) is an immune checkpoint molecule highly expressed on many solid tumors including NB. CD276 has been characterized to be involved in tumor evasion and thus its expression is correlated with poor prognosis. These characteristics make CD276 an attractive candidate for immunotherapy. Given the significant variation of tumor antigen expression among patients, the investigators aim to examine GD2, PSMA and CD276 expression in each patient's tumor sections by IHC staining, and combine two or three highly-expressed targets for the 4SCAR-T therapy. This individualized and multi-antigen-targeted approach is a new strategy to overcome the limited clinical outcome in the 4SCAR-T therapy against NB.\n\nThe purpose of this clinical study is to assess the feasibility, safety and efficacy of the combinational GD2, PSMA and CD276 4SCAR-T cell therapy against NB. Another goal of the study is to learn more about the function of the multi-4SCAR-T cells and their persistency in the patients."

In conclusion, car-t cell therapy has achieved exciting results in blood tumors, but it has been stopped in solid tumor. The main reason for the poor effect is the existence of tumor microenvironment of solid tumor, which inhibits the chemotaxis and infiltration of car-t cells to tumor site. Therefore, in this clinical experiment, we will explore the best model of car-t therapy for solid tumor by intravenous and local tumor injection, which will bring new hope to patients with osteosarcoma, neuroblastoma and gastric cancer"

Based on data showing that within the ovarian cancer tumor microenvironment surface expression of CD16a on NK cells is diminished, the researchers hypothesize that the FT516 cellular product containing a non-cleavable CD16 will bypass the low CD16 expression issue and maximize NK cell cytotoxicity. Enoblituzumab is an Fc optimized humanized IgG1 monoclonal antibody that binds to B7-H3 (CD276). B7-H3 is an inhibitory immune checkpoint molecule that is widely expressed by a number of different tumor types and may play a key role in regulating the immune response. It is therefore hypothesized that the combination of FT516 with enoblituzumab will maximize NK cell cytotoxicity in patients with ovarian cancer."

    "details": "Pediatric patients with refractory or multiply relapsed leukemia and lymphoma do poorly with traditional chemotherapy and have overall survival rates below 20%-50% depending on a variety of disease and patient related characteristics. Approximately 10-20% of pediatric patients with pre B-ALL will relapse (1) and relapsed pre B-ALL is a leading cause of cancer death in children (2). Site of relapse and timing of first relapse from initial therapy are important factors that impact the survival rates after first relapse (3). The 5-year survival for pre B-ALL pediatric patients with early relapse is 25-50% (2). Pediatric patients who experience a late relapse have excellent survival rates with chemotherapy alone, however if they have MRD positivity after reinduction, this drops their survival rates down to 50-60% (4). The FDA approval of CD19-directed CAR-T cell therapy has increased treatment options for patients with refractory disease or those in second relapse. However, many patients, including those in first relapse do not fit the current criteria to receive this treatment. As well, regardless of the number of prior relapses, some patients in second relapse cannot tolerate the extended delay and ongoing therapy that is necessary for the commercial manufacturing of these cells at the commercial level.\n\nThis phase I/II trial will investigate a new CD19-directed CAR-T therapy manufactured locally with the goal of expediting the infusion to patients who were previously excluded, such as pediatric patients with relapsed B-cell NHL and patients in their initial (or greater) leukemic relapse. We hypothesize that CD19-directed CAR-T cells manufactured using the Miltenyi CliniMACs Prodigy System (UCD19 CAR-T) will be safe, well-tolerated, and show preliminary efficacy in pediatric patients with relapsed and/or refractory B-ALL or B-NHL. No controls will be used beyond historical comparisons."

Signaling pathway of programmed death 1 (PD-1) and its ligand PD-L1 plays an important role in suppressing immune response against tumors. PD-L1 is over-expressed in 88% of glioblastoma.\n\nWe constructed a chimeric switch receptor (CSR) containing the extracellular domain of PD1 fused to the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domain of the costimulatory molecule CD28. CSR modified T cells are able to recognize PD-L1-expressing tumor cells and transduce signals to activate T cells, which results in tumor killing. A truncated EGFR (tEGFR) which lacks of the ligand binding domain and cytoplasmic kinase domain of wildtype EGFR is incorporated into the CSR vector and is used for in vivo tracking and ablation of CSR T cells when necessary. This pilot study is to determine the safety and efficacy of autologous CSR T cells in patients with recurrent glioblastoma."

    "details": "The standard maintenance regimen in renal transplantation combines calcineurin inhibitor (CNI: ciclosporin or tacrolimus) and anti-metabolite drugs (mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) or mycophenolic acid (MPA)). CNI in the 1980s made kidney transplantation possible by drastically reducing acute rejection rates in the first year. Currently the main limitation of kidney transplantation is the occurrence of chronic graft dysfunction. While half of patients die with a functional graft, the other half return to dialysis and require retransplantation. Paradoxically, CNI has been identified as a leading cause of chronic graft dysfunction. Indeed, these molecules are nephrotoxic both : acutely and transitory due to a vasoconstrictor effect that modulates intra-renal hemodynamic and chronically due to extensive fibrosis. In the late 1990s, with the development of a new class of immunosuppressants, mammilian target of rapamycin (mTor) inhibitors (sirolimus and everolimus), CNI-free protocols were developed. The results were disappointing due in part to the undesirable effects of these treatments and secondly to the occurence of chronic rejections related to the appearance of Donor Specific Antibody (DSA) antibodies.\n\nFinally in the mid-2000s belatacept is a fusion protein (CTLA4-Ig) blocking the ligands of the main costimulatory molecule (CD28) emerged. In the Phase III princeps assay (BENEFIT), this molecule was used as a maintenance treatment following transplantation (de novo) in combination with MMF (without CNI). Compared to the control group with CNI, patients receiving belatacept had better renal function from 1 year and after 7 years survival (graft and patient) were better. These benefits were attributed, on the one hand, to the absence of CNI and, on the other hand, to a very good control of the alloimmune response demonstrated by a lower incidence of DSA in the belatacept group.\n\nDespite these excellent results, belatacept has not become the gold standard in renal transplantation for two main reasons. First, when it is used de novo (as in BENEFIT), there is a significant incidence of early rejection, known as \"costimulation blockade resistant\". The second issue is medico-economic. Indeed, to date and despite the accumulation of favorable data, in France and in most countries, belatacept has marketing authorization but is not supported by social security policy due to benefits regarded as insufficient with respect to the cost (related to the IV administration requiring hospital environment every month).\n\nConsequently, it is important to precise which recipients may benefit more from this molecule. Patients, often elderly, with poor early function of the graft due to the poor quality of a marginal / \"extended criteria\" donor, are a good indication of belatacept not used de novo but after 3 months instead of CNI. This conversion most often allows to significantly improve the renal function of these patients to a much more acceptable level which remains stable beyond and without cost in terms of rejection (probably because of the time interval with the transplant). In this situation, several series reported success rates ranging from 80 to 100% with a rejection incidence between 0 and 20%. Failures are most often due to patients with non-primary graft function.\n\nCurrently after the conversion, belatacept is always maintained indefinitely most often in association with MMF. This usage generates significant costs and in fact, limits the access of belatacept for other patients. This practice is based on the dominant idea that chronic nephrotoxicity of CNI is the cause of chronic graft dysfunction.\n\nHowever, while reversible acute toxicity, mediated by hemodynamic changes in intra-renal vascularization, is undeniable, the importance and even the reality of chronic, cumulative, irreversible CNI toxicity has been questioned during the last decade, while the importance of chronic anti-donor antibody (DSA) rejection to explain chronic graft dysfunction was demonstrated. The chronic toxicity of CNI is probable when high doses are necessary to prevent rejection during the first year but uncertain beyond.\n\nThus, the investigators assume that in patients with poor graft function at 3 months post-transplantation most of the benefit of belatacept could be obtained by a transient replacement of CNI from 3 to 12 months post-transplantation.\n\nIndeed, in these often elderly patients, who have most often received an \"extended criteria\" graft (derived from a marginal donor), presenting chronic lesions, CNI-induced intra-renal vasoconstriction could more easily evolve to irreversible lesions in the context of ischemia-reperfusion inherent in the graft itself. At 1 year after transplantation the reintroduction of CNIs at minimized doses could only moderately alter the renal function allowing to maintain them at long term.\n\nThe purpose of this study is to demonstrate the feasibility of this transient treatment strategy (from 3 to 12 months post transplantation) in patients with poor function at 3 months.\n\nFrom 3 months post-transplantation, patients will receive for 9 months (phase 1) a treatment with belatacept allowing to stop CNI. Then CNI will be reintroduced (phase 2) with a follow-up period of 6 months which will make it possible to judge the feasibility of this strategy.\n\nBelatacept is the only biotherapy introduced successfully in transplantation. But this treatment, because of the limitations raised, has not yet found a definite place. Our project is to study a practical question: can the investigators stop belatacept after having introduced it early in the context of an early dysfunction while preserving the benefits. The decisive contribution of this study would be to prove the concept of a transient treatment by belatacept which has not been reported. The medico-economic consequences would be major, the cost of a long-term treatment by belatacept, especially because of its administration in hospital, being much higher than that of a conventional treatment."

    "details": "Accelerated atherosclerosis is an established complication of systemic autoimmune diseases, particularly SLE. Young female patients with SLE are more likely to develop myocardial infarction than matched healthy controls, and CVD is nowadays one of the most common causes of death (27%) in lupus patients. While traditional CV risk factors cannot explain such increased CV morbidity associated with SLE, common disease factors shared between SLE, atherosclerosis and treatment exposure may be of outmost importance in this process. Our group made 3 findings of particular interest that could link SLE pathogenesis and atherosclerosis-associated immune dysregulation: 1/ the investigators identified specific immunometabolites (circulating nucleotide-derived metabolites adenine and N4-acetylcytidine), which are increased in the circulation of SLE patients. These immunometabolites trigger a constitutive inflammasome activation resulting in aberrant IL1-β production. Given that IL1-β inhibition was reported to significantly reduce CV events without altering lipid levels, the investigators propose that these immunometabolites may represent novel candidate biomarkers of CV risk stratification in SLE. 2/ the investigators identified OX40L as an important costimulatory molecule implicated in follicular helper T cell (Tfh) activation in SLE. Interestingly, OX40L polymorphism has been associated to both SLE and atherosclerosis, and Tfh have been recently shown to accelerate atherosclerosis progression. 3/ Immune complexes-activated platelets sustain aberrant immune response in SLE and block immunosuppressive functions of regulatory T cells (Tregs) in a P-selectin/PSGL1 dependent manner. Selectins and Tregs cell dysfunction are well accepted players in atherosclerosis pathogenesis.\n\nThus there are multiple pathways that are shared between SLE and atherosclerosis and that may results in an increased risk of CV-associated morbidity in SLE patients. Exploring these interconnected pathways in SLE patients together with traditional and other well-established disease-related factors, might lead to a better stratification of CV risk in SLE.\n\nThe aim of this study is to investigate the accuracy, predictive value and utility of immunological disease-related biomarkers in stratifying CV risk in patients with SLE."

    "details": "Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is a malignant proliferation of immature lymphoid cells within the bone marrow, blood, and extramedullary sites. According to the SEER Cancer Statistics Review, the incidence was estimated to be at around 1·6 per 100000 people in 2014, with around 6000 new cases diagnosed in 2018. This disease is more frequent in children aged 1-4 years, then drops reaching the lowermost point between 25 years and 45 years. Generally, around 60% of ALL cases are diagnosed before the age of 20 years. Despite significant improvements in 5-year overall survival reaching around 90% in children, only 25% of patients older than 50 years old were alive 5 years after diagnosis1,2. These survival figures are much worse when dealing with relapsed disease. Cases of relapsed or refractory ALL are usually offered allogeneic stem cell transplantation that can establish meaningful disease control after achieving the best disease control depicted in lack of measurable residual disease3. However, the inability of performing allogeneic stem cell transplantation in some patients, especially elderly patients, represents unmet needs for advancing treatment for these challenging ALL cases.\n\nCellular immunotherapy with CD19-directed chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cells has demonstrated encouraging results for the treatment of B-cell ALL (B-ALL). Currently used CAR T-cells are genetically engineered autologous T cells that express the antigen-binding domain linked to a costimulatory molecule and an intracellular T-cell receptor signaling domain. CAR T-cells function in a major histocompatibility complex-independent manner. Because of its expression on nearly all B-ALL, CD19 became the most sensible target. This paved the way for using tisagenlecleucel and brexucabtagene autoleucel in patients with B-ALL with astonishing outcomes4-6. However, the dependence on expression of the antigen of target can be an \"Achilles' heel\" for CAR T-cells similar to monoclonal antibodies, and loss of this target is a major escape mechanism by which cancer cells can evade immunotherapy. Mechanisms of antigenic loss may include genetic modulations, epitope masking, or a cell lineage switch with secondary loss of the target epitope7.\n\nCell plasticity is the ability of cells to be reprogrammed and to alter their fate and identity, which can enable homeostasis and restoration following injury. Pathological plasticity allows cancer cells to acquire new phenotypic and/or functional features leading to disease progression and resistance to therapy8. One of the most studied and established phenotypic and functional plasticity is KMT2A-r ALL9. The seminal work of Dr. John Dick and his lab in establishing the concept of leukemia stem cell was instrumental to the field. Transplantation of human ALL into NOD/SCID mice generates a disease in these mice that is reminiscent of the human disease10. The attributes of self-renewal and clonogenic proliferation are considered \"functional\" markers for stemness of these leukemia initiating cells. Because some of these functional assays are laborious, multiple efforts have been exerted to uncover the most accurate markers to label these cells that cab reliably predict this unique cellular population. In addition to cell-intrinsic factors for plasticity that are mentioned above, cell-extrinsic or \"niche\" elements can fuel cellular plasticity when they occur. Despite these limitations, CD34+CD38- cell fraction is most likely to harbor the most primitive and quiescent cells that can fuel disease existence11.\n\nKing Faisal Specialist Hospital and Research Center is one of the leading hospital in the region in providing novel CAR T-cell therapy for management of challenging cases of relapsed and or refractory B-ALL, and has delivered a large number of products given its excellence reputation and the large number of cases treated at the center. We aim through our study to analyze the correlation between CD19 expression across the realm of B-ALL hierarchy using samples from relapsed B-ALL patients who underwent CAR T-cells therapy at our center and weigh this against their outcomes in relation to the percent expression of CD19 at each cellular faction: CD34+CD38-, CD34+CD38+, and CD34-CD38+."

The standard treatment for this type of tumor is radiation therapy, as this type of cancer does not respond to chemotherapy or currently available targeted drugs. However, radiation therapy has been found to be ineffective and does not improve survival rates.\n\nCurrently, there is development in cancer treatment using immunotherapy, where the patient's immune cells are genetically modified to target the cancer, also known as CAR T cells, for the treatment of recurrent or refractory cancers in solid tumors and brain cancers. The research project aims to study the efficacy and safety of treating patients with pontine glioma using T cells that are antigen-specific and have signals from the interleukin-7 receptor alpha and are specific to the B7H3 antigen on the tumor surface. This research is the first of its kind in Thai patients. The research project expects that this treatment will be highly safe and effective in controlling diffuse pontine glioma."
