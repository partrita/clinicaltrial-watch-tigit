"Osteosarcoma, Resection Margins, B7-H3 Probe, Local Recurrence","Complete removal of all tumor tissue with a wide surgical margin is essential for the treatment of osteosarcoma (OS). However, it's difficult, sometimes impossible, to achieve due to the invisible small satellite lesions and blurry tumor boundaries. Besides, intraoperative frozen-section analysis of resection margins of OS is often restricted by the hard tissues around OS, which makes it impossible to know whether a negative margin is achieved. Herein, based on the high expression of B7-H3 in OS, a targeted probe B7H3-IRDye800CW is synthesized by conjugating anti-B7H3 antibody and IRDye800CW. This trial is aimed to investigate R0-resection rate and 2-y local recurrence rate after using this probe in Musculoskeletal tumor surgery for osteosarcoma as well as the safety parameters of this probe in human.",32,NCT06778603,2026-02-05,2025-01-11,No Change,B7-H3 NIR Imaging for Osteosarcoma Surgery,"PHASE1, PHASE2",Safety,Peking University People's Hospital,RECRUITING,2026-12-31,2024-01-01,B7-H3

The safety of iC9-CAR.B7-H3 T cells will be investigated using a modified 3+3 design with a starting dose of 1 × 106 transduced cells/kg. The data from the dose escalation will be used to determine a recommended phase 2 dose, which will be decided based on the maximum tolerated dose and additional factors such as the ability to manufacture sufficient cells for infusion.

The body has different ways of fighting cancer and other diseases; however, no single way seems perfect. The experimental treatment in this study combines two different ways the body fights cancer, and they are antibodies and T cells. Antibodies are proteins that protect the body from foreign invaders like bacteria. Antibodies work by attaching to these bacteria or substances, which stops them from growing and causing bad effects. T cells are special infection-fighting blood cells that can kill viruses and other cells, including tumor cells. Antibodies and T cells have been used to treat patients with cancer. They both have shown promise, but neither alone has been able to cure most patients. The treatment that is being studied in this study is called autologous T lymphocyte chimeric antigen receptor cells targeted against the B7-H3 antigen and containing inducible caspase 9 safety switch (iC9). The short name for this treatment is iC9.CAR.B7-H3 T cells.

Solid Tumor,"Background: Patients with refractory and/or recurrent solid tumors have poor prognosis despite complex multimodal therapy; therefore, novel curative approaches are needed. The investigators are attempting to use T cells obtained directly from the patient, which can be genetically modified to express a 4th generation CD276-specific chimeric antigen receptor (4SCAR-276). The CAR molecules enable the T cells to recognize and kill tumor cells through the recognition of the surface CD276, which is expressed at high levels on tumor cells including brain tumors, Ewing's sarcoma (PNET) and many other tumors but not at significant levels on normal tissues. This study will evaluate the side effects and the best dose of a novel 4th generation anti-CD276 CAR T cells to target refractory and/or recurrent solid tumors.

Design:

1. Participants will be screened through physical exam and medical history. Blood and tumor tissue samples will be collected. Imaging studies will be performed.
2. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) will be obtained by apheresis, and T cells will be activated and modified to express the 4SCAR-276 gene.
3. On Day -5 to -7, PBMC will be activated and enriched for T cells, which will be followed by 4SCAR-276 lentiviral transduction. The total culture time is approximately 5-7 days.
4. Participants will receive a preparative conditioning regimen comprising cyclophosphamide/fludarabine to prepare their immune system to accept the modified CAR T cells.

Ovarian cancer cells carry a substance called B7-H3 which is not found in other healthy cells. the subject's T cells will be modified to make CAR.B7-H3 T cells so they may attack and destroy ovarian cancer cells that carry the B7-H3 substance.

If they continue to meet the eligibility criteria, the modified CAR.B7-H3 T cells will be given to them 2-14 days after the last lymphodepletion chemotherapy session. Three infusions of the CAR.B7-H3 T cells may be given to the subject through a catheter in the abdomen. Infusions will be done once a week.

Lymphodepletion chemotherapy and infusion of the CAR.B7-H3 T cells will happen at UNC Cancer Hospital. On the days the subjects receive the CAR.B7-H3 T cells infusion- Blood, fluid, and tumor samples will be collected from the subject for research purposes. Tumor biopsies are a mandatory part of this research.

Post infusion visits are - 3, 4, and 6 weeks. Additional visits will happen every 3 months for one year after the last infusion. Similar follow-up clinic visits will be completed annually, for a total of 5 years.

"Rhabdomyosarcoma, Ewing Sarcoma, Neuroblastoma, Wilms Tumor","This protocol is designed as a phase I dose-escalation study. Procurement phase: During the procurement phase of this protocol, upon SABRE Procurement Consent and procurement eligibility confirmation, participants will undergo a non-mobilized apheresis for collection of mononuclear cells to be used for the CAR-TA T cell product manufacturing.

Treatment phase: Once the CAR-TA T cell products are released and patients are confirmed eligible for CAR-TA T cell product infusion, participants will undergo protocol therapy at Children's National Hospital, consisting of a standard Lymphodepleting chemotherapy preparative regimen with fludarabine and cyclophosphamide, followed by intravenous infusion of the combined CAR-TA T cell product. The DNR-TA T cells and B7-H3 CAR T cells will be generated and combined into a final product comprised of the two T cell components combined at a 1:1 ratio. Patients will be enrolled to one of three CAR-TA T cell product dose levels (dose levels 1, 2 and 3). There are provisions in place to dose de-escalate for safety concerns (dose level -1).

Fludarabine will be administered intravenously once daily over 30 minutes, days -5 through -2 (4 doses in total). The dose of fludarabine will be 30 mg/m2 /day. Cyclophosphamide will be administered intravenously once daily over 30 minutes, days -5 and -4 (2 doses in total). The dose of cyclophosphamide will be 500 mg/m2 /day.

The first 3 patients enrolled on study will be ≥ 12 years of age at enrollment and treated at dose level 1 (1 x 10e6/kg). If no DLTs are observed in this cohort, enrollment at dose levels 2 (3 x 10e6/kg) and 3 (10 x 10e6/kg) will expand to include patients aged ≥ 1 year and \< 24 years.

Patients will remain admitted for at least 7 days following the CAR-TA T cell infusion. All infused patients will be followed with weekly visits during the 28-day dose-limiting toxicity monitoring period where they will be clinically assessed, and safety and research blood draws will be performed.

Ideally, patients should not receive other systemic or local cancer-directed therapies for at least 28 days after the CAR-TA T cell infusion.

Participants will be followed closely for 1 year following the CAR-TA T-cell infusion. After 1 year, yearly assessments will be done up to 15 years. The visits will consist of labs and examinations as well as talking to participants about how they are feeling. Participants will be followed for toxicity until the last follow-up post CAR-TA T cell product administration.

This study will be conducted at Children's National Hospital (CNH). Cell culture manipulations will be carried out in the CETI Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) facility within Children's National Hospital using current standard operating procedures (SOPs).
