import json

import glob

history_files = glob.glob("data/history/*_history.json")

if not history_files:
    print("No history recorded yet.")
else:
    for h_file in history_files:
        trial_id = os.path.basename(h_file).replace("_history.json", "")
        print(f"### {trial_id}")
        with open(h_file, "r") as f:
            history = json.load(f)
        
        for record in reversed(history):
            print(f"**Date:** {record['timestamp']}")
            print(f"\n{record['diff']}\n")
            print("---")
