## 2025-05-14 - Python Code Injection in Quarto Templates
**Vulnerability:** The `generate_target_pages.py` script was directly embedding the `target_name` from `trials.yaml` into Python code blocks within generated `.qmd` files. This allowed for arbitrary Python code execution when Quarto rendered the website.
**Learning:** Even static site generators can be vulnerable to code injection if they support dynamic execution (like Quarto's Python blocks) and identifiers are not sanitized before being embedded in code.
**Prevention:** Always sanitize any user-provided or external identifiers that are used to generate code, scripts, or file paths. Use a whitelist of allowed characters (e.g., alphanumeric, dashes, underscores).
